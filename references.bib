	abstract = {We investigate the emission of active galactic nucleus (AGN) dusty tori in infrared domain. Following theoretical predictions derived from hydrodynamical simulations, we model the dusty torus as a 3D two-phase medium with high-density clumps and low-density medium filling the space between the clumps. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images of the torus at different wavelengths are obtained using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. Our approach of generating clumpy structure allows us to model the tori with single clumps, complex structures of merged clumps or interconnected sponge-like structure. A corresponding set of clumps-only models and models with smooth dust distribution is calculated for comparison. We found that dust distribution, optical depth, clump size and their actual arrangement in the innermost region all have an impact on the shape of near- and mid-infrared SED. The 10-μm silicate feature can be suppressed for some parameters, but models with smooth dust distribution are also able to produce a wide range of silicate feature strength. Finally, we find that having the dust distributed in a two-phase medium might offer a natural solution to the lack of emission in near-infrared, compared to observed data, which affects clumpy models currently available in the literature.},

	abstract = {Finding the first generation of galaxies in the early Universe is the greatest step forward towards understanding galaxy formation and evolution. For a strategic survey of such galaxies and the interpretation of the obtained data, this paper presents an ultraviolet-to-optical spectral model of galaxies with a great care of the nebular emission. In particular, we present a machine-readable table of intensities of 119 nebular emission lines from Lyα to the rest-frame 1 ?m as a function of metallicity from zero to the solar one. Based on the spectral model, we present criteria of equivalent widths of Lyα, He IIλ1640, Hα, Hβ and [O III]λ5007 to select extremely metal-poor and metal-free galaxies although these criteria have uncertainty caused by the Lyman continuum escape fraction and the star formation duration. We also present criteria of broad-band colours which will be useful to select candidates for spectroscopic follow-up from drop-out galaxies. We propose the line intensity ratio of [O III]λ5007 to Hβ \&lt; 0.1 as the most robust criterion for \&lt;1/1000 of the solar metallicity. This ratio of a galaxy with a few M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at z∼ 8 is detectable by spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope within a reasonable exposure time.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m\&gt;{\textasciitilde}1 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.08 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and a variance in logarithmic mass σ{\textasciitilde}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and σ{\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BD{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.1 pc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages \&gt;{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfvénic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

	abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 μm of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\textasciitilde}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\textasciitilde}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\textasciitilde}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is {\textasciitilde}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

	abstract = {The primary source of emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the accretion disc, is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick dusty structure (`the so-called dusty torus'). The infrared radiation emitted by the dust is nothing but a reprocessed fraction of the accretion disc emission, so the ratio of the torus to the AGN luminosity (Ltorus/LAGN) should corresponds to the fraction of the sky obscured by dust, I.e. the covering factor. We undertook a critical investigation of the Ltorus/LAGN as the dust covering factor proxy. Using state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we calculated a grid of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) emitted by the clumpy two-phase dusty structure. With this grid of SEDs, we studied the relation between Ltorus/LAGN and the dust covering factor for different parameters of the torus. We found that in the case of type 1 AGNs the torus anisotropy makes Ltorus/LAGN underestimate low covering factors and overestimate high covering factors. In type 2 AGNs Ltorus/LAGN always underestimates covering factors. Our results provide a novel easy-to-use method to account for anisotropy and obtain correct covering factors. Using two samples from the literature, we demonstrated the importance of our result for inferring the obscured AGN fraction. We found that after the anisotropy is properly accounted for, the dust covering factors show very weak dependence on LAGN, with values in the range of ≈0.6-0.7. Our results also suggest a higher fraction of obscured AGNs at high luminosities than those found by X-ray surveys, in part owing to the presence of a Compton-thick AGN population predicted by population synthesis models.},

	abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of {\textasciitilde}1 kpc. We have obtained a {\textasciitilde}29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z {\textgreater} 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M sun yr-1, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of {\textasciitilde}2 × 1011 M sun. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [N II]/Hα, [S II]/Hα, and [O II]/[O III] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is {\textless}1\% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes lsim8\% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up lsim10\% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to {\textasciitilde}40\% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

Although conclusive evidence for no one mechanism exists, the momentum, energy, and mass-loading budgets observed compare well with theory. ▪ A model in which star formation provides a force ∼L/c, where L is the bolometric luminosity, and cool gas is pushed out of the galaxy\&apos;s gravitational potential, compares well with available data. The wind power is ∼0.1 of that provided by SNe. ▪ The very hot X-ray-emitting phase may be a (or the) prime mover. Momentum and energy exchange between the hot and cooler phases is critical to the gas dynamics. ▪ Gaps in our observational knowledge include the hot gas kinematics and the size and structure of the outflows probed with UV absorption lines. Simulations are needed to more fully understand mixing, cloud–radiation, cloud–cosmic ray, andcloud–hot wind interactions, the collective effects of star clusters, and both distributed andclustered SNe.

High-resolution radio imaging and multiwavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which this happens. Evidence is presented that: ▪ Relativistic AGN jets are formed when the black hole spins and the the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of gas accreting at high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence. ▪ AGN jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with a disk wind. ▪ Higher-power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a relativistic, supersonic, and proton-dominated state, and they terminate in strong, hot spot shocks; lower-power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and bubbles. ▪ Jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies, which contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum and may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently radiate synchrotron γ-rays. ▪ Jets were far more common when the Universe was a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing rapidly. ▪ Jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and limiting the growth of galaxies.

	abstract = {Galaxies are not uniformly distributed in space. On large scales, the Universe displays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on scales of ∼ 1-3 h - 1 Mpc, which lie at the intersections of long filaments of galaxies that are {\textgreater} 10 h - 1 Mpc in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space, known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between these structures. This observed large-scale structure depends both on cosmological parameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Using the two-point correlation function, one can trace the dependence of large-scale structure on galaxy properties, such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track its evolution with redshift. Comparison of the observed galaxy clustering signatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand the clustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent dark matter halos. Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter halo mass of a given galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations at different epochs, and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution models. This chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-point correlation function in both redshift and real space, presents the current results of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties, and discusses quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and filaments. The interpretation of these results with current theoretical models is also presented.},

	abstract = {In order to reproduce the high-mass end of the galaxy mass distribution, some process must be responsible for the suppression of star formation in the most massive of galaxies. Commonly active galactic nuclei (AGN) are invoked to fulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic of much debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression and enhancement of star formation in AGN hosts. Using the ZFOURGE (FourStar Galaxy Evolution) and NMBS (Newfirm Medium Band Survey) galaxy surveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited (M ≥ 1010.5 M⊙), high-luminosity (L1.4 {\textgreater} 1024 W Hz-1) sample of radio-loud AGN to a redshift of z = 2.25. In contrast to low-redshift studies, which associate radio-AGN activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z {\textgreater} 1.5 radio-AGN are hosted by star-forming galaxies. Indeed, the stellar populations of radio-AGN are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy population. Interestingly, we find that the radio-AGN fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 ≤ z {\textless} 2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-AGN duty cycle has little dependence on redshift or galaxy type. We do however see a strong relation between the radio-AGN fraction and stellar mass, with radio-AGN becoming rare below ∼1010.5 M⊙ or a halo mass of 1012 M⊙. This halo-mass threshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-AGN feedback at this mass limit. Despite this, we find that radio-AGN host star formation rates are consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy sample, suggesting that while radio-AGN are in the right place to suppress star formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible for doing so.},

	abstract = {We present the results of our spectroscopic follow-up program of the X-ray sources detected in the 942 ks exposure of the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS). A total of 288 possible counterparts were observed at the VLT with the FORS1/FORS2 spectrographs for 251 of the 349 Chandra sources (including three additional faint X-ray sources). Spectra and R-band images are shown for all the observed sources and R-K colors are given for most of them. Spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 168 X-ray sources, of which 137 have both reliable optical identification and redshift estimate (including 16 external identifications). The R{\textless}24 observed sample comprises 161 X-ray objects (181 optical counterparts), and 126 of them have unambiguous spectroscopic identification. There are two spikes in the redshift distribution, predominantly populated by type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) but also type 1 AGN and X-ray normal galaxies: the one at z=0.734 is fairly narrow (in redshift space) and comprises two clusters/groups of galaxies centered on extended X-ray sources, the second one at z=0.674 is broader and should trace a sheetlike structure. The type 1 and type 2 populations are clearly separated in X-ray/optical diagnostics involving parameters sensitive to absorption/reddening: X-ray hardness ratio (HR), optical/near-IR color, soft X-ray flux, and optical brightness. Nevertheless, these two populations cover similar ranges of hard X-ray luminosity and absolute K magnitude, thus trace similar levels of gravitational accretion. Consequently, we introduce a new classification based solely on X-ray properties, HR, and X-ray luminosity, consistent with the unified AGN model. This X-ray classification uncovers a large fraction of optically obscured, X-ray-luminous AGNs missed by the classical optical classification. We find a similar number of X-ray type 1 and type 2 QSOs [LX(0.5-10keV){\textgreater}1044 ergs s-1] at z{\textgreater}2 (13 sources with unambiguous spectroscopic identification); most X-ray type 1 QSOs are bright, R{\textless}{\textasciitilde}24, whereas most X-ray type 2 QSOs have R{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}24, which may explain the difference with the CDFN results as few spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for R{\textgreater}24 CDFN X-ray counterparts. There are X-ray type 1 QSOs down to z{\textasciitilde}0.5, but a strong decrease at z{\textless}2 in the fraction of luminous X-ray type 2 QSOs may indicate a cosmic evolution of the X-ray luminosity function of the type 2 population. An X-ray spectral analysis is required to confirm this possible evolution. The red color of most X-ray type 2 AGNs could be due to dust associated with the X-ray absorbing material and/or a substantial contribution of the host galaxy light. The latter can also be important for some redder X-ray type 1 AGNs. There is a large population of EROs (R-K{\textgreater}5) as X-ray counterparts, and their fraction strongly increases with decreasing optical flux, up to 25\% for the R{\textgreater}=24 sample. They cover the whole range of X-ray hardness ratios, comprise objects of various classes (in particular a high fraction of z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 X-ray absorbed AGNs, but also elliptical and starburst galaxies) and more than half of them should be fairly bright X-ray sources [LX(0.5-10keV){\textgreater}1042 ergs s-1]. Photometric redshifts will be necessary to derive the properties and evolution of the X-ray selected EROs.

	abstract = {Selection of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared facilitates the discovery of AGNs whose optical emission is extinguished by dust. In this paper, we use the Spitzer Space Telescope First Look Survey (FLS) to assess the fraction of AGNs with mid-infrared (MIR) luminosities that are comparable to quasars and that are missed in optical quasar surveys because of dust obscuration. We begin by using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database to identify 54 quasars within the 4 deg2 extragalactic FLS. These quasars occupy a distinct region in MIR color space by virtue of their strong, red continua. This has allowed us to define an MIR color criterion for selecting AGN candidates. About 2000 FLS objects have colors that are consistent with them being AGNs, but most are much fainter in the MIR than the SDSS quasars, which typically have 8 μm flux densities S8.0{\textasciitilde}1 mJy. We have investigated the properties of 43 objects with S8.0{\textgreater}=1 mJy that satisfy our AGN color selection. This sample should contain both unobscured quasars as well as AGNs that are absent from the SDSS survey because of extinction in the optical. After removing 16 known quasars, three probable normal quasars, and eight spurious or confused objects from the initial sample of 43, we are left with 16 objects that are likely to be obscured quasars or luminous Seyfert 2 galaxies. This suggests that the numbers of obscured and unobscured AGNs are similar in samples selected in the MIR at S8.0{\textasciitilde}1 mJy.},

	abstract = {We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the Galactic center source associated with a supermassive black hole. These observations were conducted in 2017 using a global interferometric array of eight telescopes operating at a wavelength of λ = 1.3 mm. The EHT data resolve a compact emission region with intrahour variability. A variety of imaging and modeling analyses all support an image that is dominated by a bright, thick ring with a diameter of 51.8 ± 2.3 μas (68\% credible interval). The ring has modest azimuthal brightness asymmetry and a comparatively dim interior. Using a large suite of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the EHT images of Sgr A* are consistent with the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole with mass {\textasciitilde}4 × 106 M ⊙, which is inferred to exist at this location based on previous infrared observations of individual stellar orbits, as well as maser proper-motion studies. Our model comparisons disfavor scenarios where the black hole is viewed at high inclination (i {\textgreater} 50°), as well as nonspinning black holes and those with retrograde accretion disks. Our results provide direct evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and for the first time we connect the predictions from dynamical measurements of stellar orbits on scales of 103-105 gravitational radii to event-horizon-scale images and variability. Furthermore, a comparison with the EHT results for the supermassive black hole M87* shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity spanning over three orders of magnitude in central mass.},

	abstract = {We investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function of galaxies in hierarchical clustering models. Beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos in the ΛCDM (Λ cold dark matter) cosmology, we show, in incremental steps, how gas cooling, photoionization at high redshift, feedback processes, galaxy merging, and thermal conduction affect the shape of the luminosity function. We consider three processes whereby supernovae and stellar wind energy can affect the forming galaxy: (1) the reheating of cold disk gas to the halo temperature; (2) expansion of the hot, diffuse halo gas; and (3) complete expulsion of cold disk gas from the halo. We demonstrate that while feedback of form 1 is able to flatten the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function, this process alone does not produce the sharp cutoff observed at large luminosities. Feedback of form 2 is also unable to solve the problem at the bright end of the luminosity function. The relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling in massive halos is strongly suppressed. This might happen if thermal conduction near the centers of halos is very efficient, or if a substantial amount of gas is expelled from halos by process 3 above. Conduction is a promising mechanism, but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the desired level. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright galaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernova explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of central supermassive black holes and the associated energy generation play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars that form in the host galaxy. The models that best reproduce the galaxy luminosity function also give reasonable approximations to the Tully-Fisher relation and the galaxy autocorrelation function.},

	abstract = {We investigate the balance of power between stars and AGN across cosmic history, based on the comparison between the infrared (IR) galaxy luminosity function (LF) and the IR AGN LF. The former corresponds to emission from dust heated by stars and AGN, whereas the latter includes emission from AGN-heated dust only. We find that at all redshifts (at least up to z {\textasciitilde} 2.5), the high-luminosity tails of the two LFs converge, indicating that the most IR-luminous galaxies are AGN-powered. Our results shed light to the decades-old conundrum regarding the flatter high-luminosity slope seen in the IR galaxy LF compared to that in the UV and optical. We attribute this difference to the increasing fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies with increasing total IR luminosity (LIR). We partition the LIR-z parameter space into a star formation-dominated and an AGN-dominated region, finding that the most luminous galaxies at all epochs lie in the AGN-dominated region. This sets a potential 'limit' to attainable star formation rates, casting doubt on the abundance of 'extreme starbursts': if AGN did not exist, LIR {\textgreater} 1013 L⊙ galaxies would be significantly rarer than they currently are in our observable Universe. We also find that AGN affect the average dust temperatures (Tdust) of galaxies and hence the shape of the well-known LIR-Tdust relation. We propose that the reason why local ULIRGs are hotter than their high-redshift counterparts is because of a higher fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies amongst the former group.},

Recent years have seen remarkable advances in our understanding of how these BHs form and grow over cosmic time, during which they are revealed as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, despite decades of research, we still lack a coherent picture of the physical drivers of BH growth, the connection between the growth of BHs and their host galaxies, the role of large-scale environment on the fueling of BHs, and the impact of BH-driven outflows on the growth of galaxies. In this paper we review our progress in addressing these key issues, motivated by the science presented at the "What drives the growth of black holes?" workshop held at Durham on 26-29th July 2010, and discuss how these questions may be tackled with current and future facilities.},

Methods: The A3COSMOS survey utilizes all publicly available ALMA data in the COSMOS field and therefore has inhomogeneous coverage in terms of observing wavelength and depth. In order to derive the luminosity functions and star formation rate densities, we applied a newly developed method that corrects the statistics of an inhomogeneously sampled survey of individual pointings to those representing an unbiased blind survey. Results: We find our sample to mostly consist of massive (M⋆ ∼ 1010 − 1012 M⊙) IR-bright (L* ∼ 1011 − 1013.5 L⊙) highly star-forming (SFR ∼100 − 1000 M⊙ yr−1) galaxies. We find an evolutionary trend in the typical density (Φ*) and luminosity (L*) of the galaxy population that respectively decreases and increases with redshift. Our infrared luminosity function (LF) is in agreement with previous literature results, and we were able to extend the constraints on the knee and bright end of the LF to high redshift (z {\textgreater} 3) by using the Herschel data. Finally, we obtained the star formation rate density up to z ∼ 6 by integrating the IR LF, finding a broad peak from z ∼ 1 to z ∼ 3 and a decline toward higher redshifts, in agreement with recent IR/millimeter-based studies, within the uncertainties. These results imply the presence of larger quantities of dust than what is expected based on optical/UV studies.},

We find that 37 per cent of the Herschel-selected sample shows signatures of nuclear activity at the 99 per cent confidence level. The probability of revealing AGN activity increases for bright (L1-1000 {\textgreater} 1011 L⊙) star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 0.3, becoming about 80 per cent for the brightest (L1-1000 {\textgreater} 1012 L⊙) infrared (IR) galaxies at z ≥ 1.

Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector- α, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts Hα luminosities with a scatter of ∼0.18 dex and an offset of ∼0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the Hα luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and Hδ. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We combine a parametric description of the star formation history with a closed-box evolution of metallicity where the present-day gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy is a free parameter. We show with this approach that we are able to recover the observationally determined cosmic star formation history (CSFH), an indication that stars are being formed in the correct epoch of the Universe, on average, for the manner in which we are conducting SED fitting. We also show the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies of different present-day visual morphologies and stellar masses. Our analysis suggests that half of the mass in present-day elliptical galaxies was in place 11 Gyr ago. In other morphological types, the stellar mass formed later, up to 6 Gyr ago for present-day irregular galaxies. Similarly, the most massive galaxies in our sample were shown to have formed half their stellar mass by 11 Gyr ago, whereas the least massive galaxies reached this stage as late as 4 Gyr ago (the well-known effect of 'galaxy downsizing'). Finally, our metallicity approach allows us to follow the average evolution in gas-phase metallicity for populations of galaxies and extract the evolution of the cosmic metal mass density in stars and in gas, producing results in broad agreement with independent, higher redshift observations of metal densities in the Universe.},

Some recent analyses of z{\textasciitilde}6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a decline from z=3 to z{\textasciitilde}6, but there is still very little constraint on the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a decade, numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density spanning z=0 to as high as z{\textasciitilde}6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy evolution, and a summary of existing SFR density measurements is presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the entire range 0Q] and density evolution [φ{\textasciitilde}(1+z)P] is found. Combining the constraints from the global SFR density evolution with those from the 1.4 GHz radio source counts at submillijansky levels allows this degeneracy to be broken and a best-fitting evolutionary form to be established.

Adopting a Baldry-Glazebrook initial mass function we use these relations and apply PEGASE.2 to predict the z = 0 cosmic spectral energy distributions (CSEDs) of spheroids and discs. The model predictions compare favourably to the dust-corrected CSED recently reported by the Galaxy And Mass Assembly team from the far-ultraviolet through to the K band. The model also provides a reasonable fit to the total stellar mass contained within spheroid and disc structures as recently reported by the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue team. Three interesting inferences can be made following our axioms: (1) there is a transition redshift at z ≈ 1.7 at which point the Universe switches from what we refer to as `hot mode evolution' (i.e. spheroid formation/growth via mergers and/or collapse) to what we term `cold mode evolution' (i.e. disc formation/growth via gas infall and minor mergers); (2) there is little or no need for any pre-enrichment prior to the main phase of star formation; (3) in the present Universe mass loss is fairly evenly balanced with star formation holding the integrated stellar mass density close to a constant value. The model provides a simple prediction of the energy output from spheroid and disc projenitors, the build-up of spheroid and disc mass and the mean metallicity enrichment of the Universe.},

The constraints are based on an observational compilation that includes observations in the rest-frame IR, B band, UV, soft, and hard X-ray in past decades. Our method follows Hopkins et al. with an updated quasar SED model and bolometric and extinction corrections. The new best-fitting bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves qualitatively different from the old Hopkins model at high redshift. Compared with the old model, the number density normalization decreases towards higher redshift and the bright-end slope is steeper at z ≳ 2. Due to the paucity of measurements at the faint end, the faint end slope at z ≳ 5 is quite uncertain. We present two models, one featuring a progressively steeper faint-end slope at higher redshift and the other featuring a shallow faint-end slope at z ≳ 5. Further multiband observations of the faint-end QLF are needed to distinguish between these models. The evolutionary pattern of the bolometric QLF can be interpreted as an early phase likely dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the CXB spectrum, the SMBH mass density, and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only becomes important at z ≲ 3. The predicted CXB spectrum, cosmic SMBH mass density, and SMBH mass function are generally consistent with existing observations.},

AGN can also leave an imprint on a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED) through the re-processing of photons by the dusty torus. Using the SED fitting code PROSPECT with an incorporated AGN component, we fit the far-ultraviolet to far-infrared SEDs of {\textasciitilde}494 000 galaxies in the D10-COSMOS field and {\textasciitilde}230 000 galaxies from the GAMA survey. By combining an AGN component with a flexible star formation and metallicity implementation, we obtain estimates for the AGN luminosities, stellar masses, star formation histories, and metallicity histories for each of our galaxies. We find that PROSPECT can identify AGN components in 91 per cent of galaxies pre-selected as containing AGN through narrow-emission line ratios and the presence of broad lines. Our PROSPECT-derived AGN luminosities show close agreement with luminosities derived for X-ray selected AGN using both the X-ray flux and previous SED fitting results. We show that incorporating the flexibility of an AGN component when fitting the SEDs of galaxies with no AGN has no significant impact on the derived galaxy properties. However, in order to obtain accurate estimates of the stellar properties of AGN host galaxies, it is crucial to include an AGN component in the SED fitting process. We use our derived AGN luminosities to map the evolution of the AGN luminosity function for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 and find good agreement with previous measurements and predictions from theoretical models.},

	abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z{\textasciitilde}6, with especially tight constraints for z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino (νe) flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

Our values agree well with previously reported measurements and constitute a representative and homogeneous data set spanning a broad range in stellar-mass (108-1012 M⊙), dust-mass (106-109 M⊙), and star formation rates (0.01-100 M⊙yr-1), and over a broad redshift range (0.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0). We combine these data to measure the cosmic star formation history (CSFH), the stellar-mass density (SMD), and the dust-mass density (DMD) over a 12 Gyr timeline. The data mostly agree with previous estimates, where they exist, and provide a quasi-homogeneous data set using consistent mass and star formation estimators with consistent underlying assumptions over the full time range. As a consequence our formal errors are significantly reduced when compared to the historic literature. Integrating our CSFH we precisely reproduce the SMD with an interstellar medium replenishment factor of 0.50 ± 0.07, consistent with our choice of Chabrier initial mass function plus some modest amount of stripped stellar mass. Exploring the cosmic dust density evolution, we find a gradual increase in dust density with lookback time. We build a simple phenomenological model from the CSFH to account for the dust-mass evolution, and infer two key conclusions: (1) For every unit of stellar mass which is formed 0.0065-0.004 units of dust mass is also formed. (2) Over the history of the Universe approximately 90-95 per cent of all dust formed has been destroyed and/or ejected.},

	abstract = {We present the observed fraction of galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) as a function of environment in the early data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Using 4921 galaxies in the redshift range 0.05{\textless}=z{\textless}=0.095 and brighter than M(r*)=-20.0 (or M*+1.45), we find at least {\textasciitilde}20\% of these galaxies possess an unambiguous detection of an AGN, but this fraction could be as high as {\textasciitilde}=40\% after we model the ambiguous emission-line galaxies in our sample. We have studied the environmental dependence of galaxies, using the local galaxy density as determined from the distance to the 10th nearest neighbor. As expected, we observe that the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with density, while the fraction of passive galaxies (no emission lines) increases with density. In contrast, the fraction of galaxies with an AGN remains constant from the cores of galaxy clusters to the rarefied field population. We conclude that the presence of an AGN is independent of the disk component of a galaxy. We have extensively tested our results, and they are robust against measurement error, definition of an AGN, aperture bias, stellar absorption, survey geometry, and signal-to-noise ratio. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a supermassive black hole resides in the bulge of all massive galaxies, and {\textasciitilde}=40\% of these black holes are seen as AGNs in our sample. A high fraction of local galaxies with an AGN suggests either that the mean lifetime of these AGNs is longer than previously thought (i.e., {\textgreater}=108 yr) or that the AGNs burst more often than expected: {\textasciitilde}40 times over the redshift range of our sample.

	abstract = {IRAS flux densities, redshifts, and infrared luminosities are reported for all sources identified in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS), a complete flux-limited survey of all extragalactic objects with total 60 μm flux density greater than 5.24 Jy, covering the entire sky surveyed by IRAS at Galactic latitudes {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textgreater}5°. The RBGS includes 629 objects, with median and mean sample redshifts of 0.0082 and 0.0126, respectively, and a maximum redshift of 0.0876. The RBGS supersedes the previous two-part IRAS Bright Galaxy Samples (BGS1+BGS2), which were compiled before the final (Pass 3) calibration of the IRAS Level 1 Archive in 1990 May. The RBGS also makes use of more accurate and consistent automated methods to measure the flux of objects with extended emission. The RBGS contains 39 objects that were not present in the BGS1+BGS2, and 28 objects from the BGS1+BGS2 have been dropped from RBGS because their revised 60 μm flux densities are not greater than 5.24 Jy. Comparison of revised flux measurements for sources in both surveys shows that most flux differences are in the range {\textasciitilde}5\%-25\%, although some faint sources at 12 and 25 μm differ by as much as a factor of 2. Basic properties of the RBGS sources are summarized, including estimated total infrared luminosities, as well as updates to cross identifications with sources from optical galaxy catalogs established using the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. In addition, an atlas of images from the Digitized Sky Survey with overlays of the IRAS position uncertainty ellipse and annotated scale bars is provided for ease in visualizing the optical morphology in context with the angular and metric size of each object. The revised bolometric infrared luminosity function, φ(Lir), for infrared-bright galaxies in the local universe remains best fit by a double power law, φ(L){\textasciitilde}Lα, with α=-0.6(+/-0.1) and α=-2.2(+/-0.1) below and above the ``characteristic'' infrared luminosity L*ir{\textasciitilde}1010.5Lsolar, respectively.

The redshift distribution of these SPIRE sources from the Herschel Multitiered Extragalactic Survey peaks at z = 0.85, with 731 sources at z {\textless} 2 and a tail of sources out to z ∼ 5. We measure more significant disagreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts (〈Δz/(1 + zspec)〉 = 0.29) than is seen in non-infrared selected samples, likely due to enhanced star formation rates and dust obscuration in infrared-selected galaxies. The infrared data are used to directly measure integrated infrared luminosities and dust temperatures independent of radio or 24 μm flux densities. By probing the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) at its peak, we estimate that the vast majority (72\%–83\%) of z {\textless} 2 Herschel-selected galaxies would drop out of traditional submillimeter surveys at 0.85–1 mm. We find that dust temperature traces infrared luminosity, due in part to the SPIRE wavelength selection biases, and partially from physical effects. As a result, we measure no significant trend in SPIRE color with redshift; if dust temperature were independent of luminosity or redshift, a trend in SPIRE color would be expected. Composite infrared SEDs are constructed as a function of infrared luminosity, showing the increase in dust temperature with luminosity, and subtle change in near-infrared and mid-infrared spectral properties. Moderate evolution in the far-infrared (FIR)/radio correlation is measured for this partially radio-selected sample, with qIR∝(1 + z)−0.30 ± 0.02 at z {\textless} 2. We estimate the luminosity function and implied star formation rate density contribution of HSGs at z {\textless} 1.6 and find overall agreement with work based on 24 μm extrapolations of the LIRG, ULIRG, and total infrared contributions. This work significantly increased the number of spectroscopically confirmed infrared-luminous galaxies at z ≫ 0 and demonstrates the growing importance of dusty starbursts for galaxy evolution studies and the build-up of stellar mass throughout cosmic time.},

	abstract = {Aims: We provide the most accurate estimate yet of the bright end of the infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) and the abundance of hyperluminous IR galaxies (HLIRGs) with IR luminosities {\textgreater}1013L⊙, thanks to the combination of the high sensitivity, angular resolution, and large area of the LOFAR Deep Fields, which probes an unprecedented dynamic range of luminosity and volume. Methods: We cross-match Herschel sources and LOFAR sources in Boötes (8.63 deg2), Lockman Hole (10.28 deg2), and ELAIS-N1 (6.74 deg2) with rms sensitivities of {\textasciitilde}32, 22, and 20 μJy beam−1, respectively. We divide the matched samples into "unique" and "multiple" categories. For the multiple matches, we de-blend the Herschel fluxes using the LOFAR positions and the 150-MHz flux densities as priors. We perform spectral energy distribution fitting, combined with multi-wavelength counterpart identifications and photometric redshift estimates, to derive IR luminosities. Results: The depth of the LOFAR data allows us to identify highly complete ({\textasciitilde}92\% completeness) samples of bright Herschel sources with a simple selection based on the 250 μm flux density (45, 40, and 35 mJy in Boötes, Lockman Hole, and ELAIS-N1, respectively). Most of the bright Herschel sources fall into the unique category (i.e. a single LOFAR counterpart). For the multiple matches, there is excellent correspondence between the radio emission and the far-IR emission. We find a good agreement in the IR LFs with a previous study out to z {\textasciitilde} 6 which used de-blended Herschel data. Our sample gives the strongest and cleanest indication to date that the population of HLIRGs has surface densities of {\textasciitilde}5 to {\textasciitilde}18/deg2 (with variations due to a combination of the applied flux limit and cosmic variance) and an uncertainty of a factor of ≲2. In comparison, the GALFORM semi-analytic model significantly under-predicts the abundance of HLIRGs.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive investigation of the cosmological evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared (IR). Based on the observed dichotomy in the ages of stellar populations of early-type galaxies on one side and late-type galaxies on the other, the model interprets the epoch-dependent luminosity functions at z {\textgreater}= 1.5 using a physical approach for the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies and of the associated AGNs, while IR galaxies at z {\textless} 1.5 are interpreted as being mostly late-type "cold" (normal) and "warm" (starburst) galaxies. As for proto-spheroids, in addition to the epoch-dependent luminosity functions of stellar and AGN components separately, we have worked out, for the first time, the evolving luminosity functions of these objects as a whole (stellar plus AGN component), taking into account in a self-consistent way the variation with galactic age of the global spectral energy distribution. The model provides a physical explanation for the observed positive evolution of both galaxies and AGNs up to z {\textasciitilde}= 2.5 and for the negative evolution at higher redshifts, for the sharp transition from Euclidean to extremely steep counts at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, as well as the (sub-)millimeter counts of strongly lensed galaxies that are hard to account for by alternative, physical or phenomenological, approaches. The evolution of late-type galaxies and z {\textless} 1.5 AGNs is described using a parametric phenomenological approach. The modeled AGN contributions to the counts and to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) are always sub-dominant. They are maximal at mid-IR wavelengths: the contribution to the 15 and 24 μm counts reaches 20\% above 10 and 2 mJy, respectively, while the contributions to the CIB are of 8.6\% and of 8.1\% at 15 μm and 24 μm, respectively. The model provides a good fit to the multi-wavelength (from the mid-IR to millimeter waves) data on luminosity functions at different redshifts and on number counts (both global and per redshift slices). A prediction of the present model, useful to test it, is a systematic variation with wavelength of the populations dominating the counts and the contributions to the CIB intensity. This implies a specific trend for cross-wavelength CIB power spectra, which is found to be in good agreement with the data.},

	abstract = {We report the first results from the Z -FOURGE survey: the discovery of a candidate galaxy cluster at z = 2.2 consisting of two compact overdensities with red galaxies detected at {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 20σ above the mean surface density. The discovery was made possible by a new deep (Ks {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 24.8 AB 5σ) Magellan/FOURSTAR near-IR imaging survey with five custom medium-bandwidth filters. The filters pinpoint the location of the Balmer/4000 Å break in evolved stellar populations at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5, yielding significantly more accurate photometric redshifts than possible with broadband imaging alone. The overdensities are within 1' of each other in the COSMOS field and appear to be embedded in a larger structure that contains at least one additional overdensity ({\textasciitilde}10σ). Considering the global properties of the overdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of a galaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. A comparison to a large ΛCDM simulation suggests that the system may consist of merging subclusters, with properties in between those of z {\textgreater} 2 protoclusters with more diffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusters with prominent red sequences. The structure is completely absent in public optical catalogs in COSMOS and only weakly visible in a shallower near-IR survey. The discovery showcases the potential of deep near-IR surveys with medium-band filters to advance the understanding of environment and galaxy evolution at z {\textgreater} 1.5.

FourStar has an all-refractive optical system, four HAWAII-2RG detectors, and Teledyne electronics. The pixel scale of 0.159″ pixel-1 produces a 10.8′ × 10.8′ field of view. Ten filters are available across the Y, J, H, and Ks bands. We present the optical, mechanical, thermal, electronic, and software design choices and their associated engineering implementations. The detector readout electronics, control system, and the automatic data acquisition hardware are also described. Laboratory and on-sky performance data are presented. FourStar has excellent image quality, easily meeting the requirement of critically sampling the median seeing disk. The throughput is ≈0.5–0.6 across its wavelength coverage.

Using galaxies from the COSMOS legacy field with \$\{{\textbackslash}rm log(M\_\{*\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})\}{\textbackslash}geq9.5\$ , we use a seventh nearest neighbour density estimator to quantify galaxy environment, dividing this into bins of low-, intermediate-, and high-density. We discover new high-density environment candidates across \$2.0{\textbackslash}leq z{\textless}2.4\$ and \$3.1{\textbackslash}leq z{\textless}4.2\$ . We analyse the quiescent fraction, stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of our galaxies to understand how these vary with redshift and environment. Our results reveal that, across \$2.0{\textbackslash}leq z{\textless}2.4\$ , the high-density environments are the most significant regions, which consist of elevated quiescent fractions, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm log(M\_\{*\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})\}{\textbackslash}geq10.2\$ massive galaxies and suppressed star formation activity. At \$3.1{\textbackslash}leq z{\textless}4.2\$ , we find that high-density regions consist of elevated stellar masses but require more complete samples of quiescent and sSFR data to study the effects of environment in more detail at these higher redshifts. Overall, our results suggest that well-evolved, passive galaxies are already in place in high-density environments at \$z{\textbackslash}sim2.4\$ , and that the Butcher–Oemler effect and SFR-density relation may not reverse towards higher redshifts as previously thought.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

In addition and with reference to starburst-type spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we derive a set of equations for estimating the total infrared luminosity (LIR) in the range 8-1000μm using photometry from at least one MIPS band. 42 out of 43 of our sources' optical/infrared SEDs (λobserved {\textless} 160 μm) are starburst type, with only one object displaying a prominent power-law near-infrared continuum. For a quantitative analysis, models of radiation transfer in dusty media are fit on to the infrared photometry, revealing that the majority of galaxies are represented by high extinction, Av {\textgreater} 35, and for a large fraction ({\textasciitilde}50 per cent) the SED turns over into the Rayleigh-Jeans regime at wavelengths longward of 90μm. For comparison, we also fit semi-empirical templates based on local galaxy data; however, these underestimate the far-infrared SED shape by a factor of at least 2 and in extreme cases up to 10 for the majority ({\textasciitilde}70 per cent) of the sources. Further investigation of SED characteristics reveals that the mid-infrared (70/24μm) continuum slope is decoupled from various galaxy properties such as the total infrared luminosity and far-infrared peak, quantified by the L160/L70 ratio. In view of these results, we propose that these high-redshift galaxies have different properties to their local counterparts, in the sense that large amounts of dust cause heavy obscuration and are responsible for an additional cold emissive component, appearing as a far-infrared excess in their SEDs.},

We present the results from deep 24 μm imaging from Spitzer surveys, which include {\textasciitilde}5×104 sources to an 80\% completeness of {\textasciitilde}=60 μJy. The 24 μm counts rapidly rise at near-Euclidean rates down to 5 mJy, increase with a super-Euclidean rate between 0.4 and 4 mJy, and converge below {\textasciitilde}0.3 mJy. The 24 μm counts exceed expectations from nonevolving models by a factor of {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 at Sν{\textasciitilde}0.1 mJy. The peak in the differential number counts corresponds to a population of faint sources that is not expected from predictions based on 15 μm counts from the Infrared Space Observatory. We argue that this implies the existence of a previously undetected population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}1-3. Integrating the counts to 60 μJy, we derive a lower limit on the 24 μm background intensity of 1.9+/-0.6 nW m-2 sr-1 of which the majority ({\textasciitilde}60\%) stems from sources fainter than 0.4 mJy. Extrapolating to fainter flux densities, sources below 60 μJy contribute 0.8+0.9-0.4 nW m-2 sr-1 to the background, which provides an estimate of the total 24 μm background of 2.7+1.1-0.7 nW m-2 sr-1.

	abstract = {We carried out direct measurement of the fraction of dusty sources in a sample of extremely red galaxies with (R-Ks){\textgreater}=5.3 mag and Ks{\textless}20.2 mag, using 24 μm data from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Combining deep 24 μm Ks- and R-band data over an area of {\textasciitilde}64 arcmin2 in ELAIS N1 of the Spitzer First Look Survey (FLS), we find that 50\%+/-6\% of our extremely red object (ERO) sample have measurable 24 μm flux above the 3 σ flux limit of 40 μJy. This flux limit corresponds to a star formation rate (SFR) of 12 Msolar yr-1 at z{\textasciitilde}1, much more sensitive than any previous long-wavelength measurement. The 24 μm-detected EROs have 24 μm/2.2 μm and 24 μm/0.7 μm flux ratios consistent with infrared luminous, dusty sources at z{\textgreater}=1, and are an order of magnitude too red to be explained by an infrared quiescent spiral or a pure old stellar population at any redshift. Some of these 24 μm-detected EROs could be active galactic nuclei; however, the fraction among the whole ERO sample is probably small, 10\%-20\%, as suggested by deep X-ray observations as well as optical spectroscopy. Keck optical spectroscopy of a sample of similarly selected EROs in the FLS field suggests that most of the EROs in ELAIS N1 are probably at z{\textasciitilde}1. The mean 24 μm flux (167 μJy) of the 24 μm-detected ERO sample roughly corresponds to the rest-frame 12 μm luminosity, νLν(12μm), of 3×1010Lsolar at z{\textasciitilde}1. Using the correlation between IRAS νLν(12μm) and infrared luminosity LIR(8-1000μm), we infer that the IR{\textgreater} of the 24 μm-detected EROs is 3×1011 and 1×1012Lsolar at z=1.0and1.5, respectively, similar to that of local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The corresponding SFR would be roughly 50-170 Msolar yr-1. If the timescale of this starbursting phase is on the order of 108 yr as inferred for the local LIRGs and ULIRGs, the lower limit on the masses of these 24 μm-detected EROs is 5×109to2×1010Msolar. It is plausible that some of the starburst EROs are in the midst of a violent transformation to become massive early type galaxies at the epoch of z{\textasciitilde}1-2.},

	abstract = {We present the deepest 100 to 500 μm far-infrared observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the GOODS-Herschel key program, and examine the infrared (IR) 3-500 μm spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5, supplemented by a local reference sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, and AKARI data. We determine the projected star formation densities of local galaxies from their radio and mid-IR continuum sizes. We find that the ratio of total IR luminosity to rest-frame 8 μm luminosity, IR8 (≡ LIRtot), follows a Gaussian distribution centered on IR8 = 4 (σ = 1.6) and defines an IR main sequence for star-forming galaxies independent of redshift and luminosity. Outliers from this main sequence produce a tail skewed toward higher values of IR8. This minority population ({\textless}20\%) is shown to consist of starbursts with compact projected star formation densities. IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star formation from compact starbursts with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness (ΣIR {\textgreater} 3 × 1010 L⊙ kpc-2) and a high specific star formation rate (i.e., starbursts). The rest-frame, UV-2700 Å size of these distant starbursts is typically half that of main sequence galaxies, supporting the correlation between star formation density and starburst activity that is measured for the local sample. Locally, luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies, (U)LIRGs (LIRtot), are systematically in the starburst mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the "normal" main sequence mode. This confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called "mid-IR excess" population of galaxies found at z {\textgreater} 1.5 by previous studies. Main sequence galaxies have strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust {\textasciitilde} 15-50 K), and an effective Tdust {\textasciitilde} 31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their infrared SED. Galaxies in the starburst regime instead exhibit weak PAH equivalent widths and a sharper far-IR bump with an effective Tdust {\textasciitilde} 40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR emission of X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN) is predominantly produced by star formation and that candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically occur in compact, dusty starbursts. After correcting for the effect of starbursts on IR8, we identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.

It has become clear, in the last decade, that a population of galaxies that radiate most of their power in the far-infrared (the so-called infrared galaxies) contributes an important part of the whole galaxy build-up in the Universe. Since 1996, detailed (and often painful) investigations of the high-redshift infrared galaxies have resulted in the spectacular progress covered in this review. We outline the nature of the sources of the CIB, including their star-formation rate, stellar and total mass, morphology, metallicity, and clustering properties. We discuss their contribution to the stellar content of the Universe and their origin in the framework of the hierarchical growth of structures. We finally discuss open questions for a scenario of their evolution up to the present-day galaxies.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ∼1\% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in ∼10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

Powerful, highly ionized winds, with velocities â¼0.1-0.2c, are a common feature in X-ray spectra of luminous AGNs, offering a plausible physical origin for the well-known connections between the hole and properties of its host. Observability constraints suggest that the winds must be episodic and detectable only for a few percent of their lifetimes. The most powerful wind feedback, establishing the M⊙ relation, is probably not directly observable at all. The M⊙ relation signals a global change in the nature of AGN feedback. At black hole masses below M⊙ feedback is confined to the immediate vicinity of the hole. At the M⊙ mass, it becomes much more energetic and widespread and can drive away much of the bulge gas as a fast molecular outflow.},

In this review, we describe a broad range of multiwavelength techniques that are currently being employed to identify obscured AGN, and we assess the reliability and completeness of each technique.

It has become clear, in the last decade, that a population of galaxies that radiate most of their power in the far-infrared (the so-called infrared galaxies) contributes an important part of the whole galaxy build-up in the Universe. Since 1996, detailed (and often painful) investigations of the high-redshift infrared galaxies have resulted in the spectacular progress covered in this review. We outline the nature of the sources of the CIB, including their star-formation rate, stellar and total mass, morphology, metallicity, and clustering properties. We discuss their contribution to the stellar content of the Universe and their origin in the framework of the hierarchical growth of structures. We finally discuss open questions for a scenario of their evolution up to the present-day galaxies.},

Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of SED shapes, as well as their dependence on luminosity, makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey. We infer the QLF break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z{\textasciitilde}4.5 and confirm at high significance ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 σ) previous claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the column density distribution and quasar SED, which both depend on luminosity, a single bolometric QLF self-consistently reproduces the observed QLFs in all bands and at all redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this luminosity dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric QLF and there is no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find that they are consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total quasar luminosity density is well constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. We provide a number of fitting functions to the bolometric QLF and its manifestations in various bands, as well as a script to return the QLF at arbitrary frequency and redshift from these fits.},

	abstract = {Infrared (IR) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution, since their most intense stages are often obscured by dust. However, local IR luminosity function estimates today are still based on the IRAS survey in the 1980s, with wavelength coverage only up to 100 μm. The AKARI IR space telescope performed an all-sky survey in six IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140 and 160 μm) with 3-10 times better sensitivity, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can much more precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (LTIR) of individual galaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the local Universe. By fitting modern IR spectral energy distribution (SED) models, we have remeasured LTIR of the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample, which is a complete sample of local galaxies with S60 μm {\textgreater} 5.24 Jy. We present mid-IR monochromatic luminosity (νLν) to LTIR correlations for Spitzer8 μm, AKARI9 μm, IRAS12 μm, WISE12 μm, ISO15 μm, AKARI18 μm, WISE22 μm and Spitzer24 μm filters. These measures of LMIR are well correlated with LTIR, with scatter in the range 13-44 per cent. The best-fitting LMIR-to-LTIR conversions provide us with estimates of LTIR using only a single MIR band, in which several deep all-sky surveys are becoming available such as AKARI MIR and WISE. Although we have found some overestimates of LTIR by IRAS due to contaminating cirrus/sources, the resulting AKARI IR luminosity function (LF) agrees well with that from IRAS. We integrate the LF weighted by LTIR to obtain a cosmic IR luminosity density of ΩTIR= (8.5+1.5-2.3) × 107 L⊙ Mpc-3, of which 7 ± 1 per cent is produced by luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) (LTIR {\textgreater} 1011 L⊙), and only 0.4 ± 0.1 per cent is from ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) (LTIR {\textgreater} 1012 L⊙) in the local Universe, in stark contrast to high-redshift results. We separate the contributions from AGN and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The SFG IR LF shows a steep decline at the bright end. Combined with high-redshift results from the AKARI NEP deep survey, these data show a strong evolution of ΩSFTIR∝ (1 +z)4.0±0.5 and ΩAGNTIR∝ (1 +z)4.4±0.4. For ΩAGNTIR, the ULIRG contribution exceeds that from LIRGs already by z∼ 1. A rapid evolution in both ΩAGNTIR and ΩSFGTIR suggests the correlation between star formation and black hole accretion rate continues up to higher redshifts. We compare the evolution of ΩAGNTIR to that of X-ray luminosity density. The ΩAGNTIR/ΩX-ray AGN ratio shows a possible increase at z {\textgreater} 1, suggesting an increase of obscured AGN at z {\textgreater} 1.},

	abstract = {We present a new backward evolution model for galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared (IR). What is new in this model is the separate study of the evolutionary properties of different IR populations (i.e. spiral galaxies, starburst galaxies, low-luminosity AGNs, 'unobscured' type 1 AGNs and 'obscured' type 2 AGNs) defined through a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of large samples of IR-selected sources. The evolutionary parameters have been constrained by means of all the available observables from surveys in the mid- and far-IR (source counts, redshift and luminosity distributions, luminosity functions). By decomposing the SEDs representative of the three AGN classes into three distinct components (a stellar component emitting most of its power in the optical/near-IR, an AGN component due to the hot dust heated by the central black hole peaking in the mid-IR, and a starburst component dominating the far-IR spectrum), we have disentangled the AGN contribution to the monochromatic and total IR luminosity emitted by different populations considered in our model from that due to star formation activity. We have then obtained an estimate of the total IR luminosity density [and star formation density (SFD) produced by IR galaxies] and the first ever estimate of the black hole mass accretion density (BHAR) from the IR. The derived evolution of the BHAR is in agreement with estimates from X-rays, though the BHAR values we derive from the IR are slightly higher than the X-ray ones. Finally, we have simulated source counts, redshift distributions, and SFD and BHAR that we expect to obtain with the future cosmological surveys in the mid-/far-IR that will be performed with the JWST-MIRI and SPICA-SAFARI.

The former corresponds to emission from dust heated by stars and AGN, whereas the latter includes emission from AGN-heated dust only. Our results show that infrared emission from AGN starts mixing into the galaxy luminosity function in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) regime and becomes significant in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) regime, with the luminosity above which local ULIRGs become AGN-dominated being in the logL\_IR/L\_\{⊙ \}∼ 12.2-12.7 range. We propose that as a result of the AGN contribution, the infrared galaxy luminosity function has a flatter high-luminosity slope than UV/optical galaxy luminosity functions. Furthermore, we note that the increased AGN contribution as a function of LIR is reflected in the average dust temperature (Tdust) of local galaxies, and may be responsible for the local LIR-Tdust relation. However, although our results show that AGN play a central role in defining the properties of local ULIRGs, we find that the dominant power source in the local ULIRG population is star formation.},

	abstract = {We present Spitzer 7-38 μm spectra for a 24 μm flux-limited sample of galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 0.7 in the COSMOS field. The detailed high-quality spectra allow us to cleanly separate star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) in individual galaxies. We first decompose mid-infrared luminosity functions (LFs). We find that the SF 8 μm and 15 μm LFs are well described by Schechter functions. AGNs dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads to the shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared LFs. The total infrared (8-1000 μm) LF from 70 μm selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-end slope than the bolometrically corrected SF 15 μm LF, owing to the intrinsic dispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. We then study the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (BHs). Seven of the thirty-one luminous infrared galaxies with Spitzer spectra host luminous AGNs, implying an AGN duty cycle of 23\% ± 9\%. The time-averaged ratio of BH accretion rate and SF rate matches the local M BH - M bulge relation and the M BH - M host relation at z {\textasciitilde} 1. These results favor co-evolution scenarios in which BH growth and intense SF happen in the same event but the former spans a shorter lifetime than the latter. Finally, we compare our mid-infrared spectroscopic selection with other AGN identification methods and discuss candidate Compton-thick AGNs in the sample. While only half of the mid-infrared spectroscopically selected AGNs are detected in X-ray, {\textasciitilde}90\% of them can be identified with their near-infrared spectral indices.},

The rest-frame 8 μm LFs for star-forming galaxies at redshifts z=1 and {\textasciitilde}2 have the same shape as at z{\textasciitilde}0, but with a strong positive luminosity evolution.

	abstract = {Context. Studies of the infrared (IR) emission of cosmic sources have proven essential to constraining the evolutionary history of cosmic star formation and the gravitational accretion of nuclear black holes, because many of these events occur inside heavily dust-extinguished environments. Aims: The Spitzer Space Telescope has provided a large amount of data to constrain the nature and cosmological evolution of infrared source populations. In the present paper we exploit a large homogeneous dataset to derive a self-consistent picture of IR emission based on the time-dependent λ\_eff = 24, 15, 12, and 8 μm monochromatic and bolometric IR luminosity functions (LF) over the full 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 redshift range. Methods: Our present analysis is based on a combination of data from deep Spitzer surveys of the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS-SWIRE) and GOODS fields. To our limiting flux of S24 = 400 μJy, our sample derived from VVDS-SWIRE includes 1494 sources, and 666 and 904 sources brighter than S24 = 80 μJy are catalogued in GOODS-S and GOODS-N, respectively, for a total area of {\textasciitilde}0.9 square degrees. Apart from a few galaxies, we obtain reliable optical identifications and redshifts for all these sources, providing a rich and robust dataset for our luminosity function determination. The final combined reliable sample includes 3029 sources, the fraction with photometric redshifts being 72\% over all redshifts and almost all galaxies at z {\textgreater} 1.5. Based on the multiwavelength information available in these areas, we constrain the LFs at 8, 12, 15, and 24 μm. We also infer the total IR luminosities from our best-fit model of the observed SEDs of each source, and use this to derive the bolometric (8-1000 μm) LF and comoving volume emissivity to z {\textasciitilde} 2.5. Results: In the redshift interval 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1, the bolometric IR luminosity density evolves as (1 + z)3.8±0.4. Although it is more uncertain at higher-z, our results show a flattening in the IR luminosity density at z {\textgreater} 1. The mean redshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: the brightest IR galaxies appear to form stars at earlier cosmic times (z {\textgreater} 1.5), while star formation in the less luminous galaxies continues until more recent epochs (z {\textasciitilde} 1 for LIR {\textless} 1011 L⊙), in overall agreement with similar analyses in the literature. Conclusions: Our results are indicative of a rapid increase in the galaxy IR comoving volume emissivity up to z {\textasciitilde} 1 and a constant average emissivity at z {\textgreater} 1. We also appear to measure a difference in the evolutionary rate of the source number densities as a function of luminosity, which is consistent with the downsizing evolutionary patterns reported for other samples of cosmic sources.},

We detect very strong luminosity evolution for the total IR LF (LIR ∝ (1 + z)3.55 ± 0.10 up to z ∼ 2, and ∝ (1 + z)1.62 ± 0.51 at 2 {\textless} z ≲ 4) combined with a density evolution (∝(1 + z)-0.57 ± 0.22 up to z ∼ 1 and ∝ (1 + z)-3.92 ± 0.34 at 1 {\textless} z ≲ 4). In agreement with previous findings, the IR luminosity density (ρIR) increases steeply to z ∼ 1, then flattens between z ∼ 1 and z ∼ 3 to decrease at z ≳ 3. Galaxies with different spectral energy distributions, masses and specific star formation rates (SFRs) evolve in very different ways and this large and deep statistical sample is the first one allowing us to separately study the different evolutionary behaviours of the individual IR populations contributing to ρIR. Galaxies occupying the well-established SFR-stellar mass main sequence (MS) are found to dominate both the total IR LF and ρIR at all redshifts, with the contribution from off-MS sources (≥0.6 dex above MS) being nearly constant (∼20 per cent of the total ρIR) and showing no significant signs of increase with increasing z over the whole 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.2 range. Sources with mass in the range 10 ≤ log(M/M⊙) ≤ 11 are found to dominate the total IR LF, with more massive galaxies prevailing at the bright end of the high-z (≳2) LF. A two-fold evolutionary scheme for IR galaxies is envisaged: on the one hand, a starburst-dominated phase in which the Super Massive Black Holes (SMBH) grows and is obscured by dust (possibly triggered by a major merging event), is followed by an AGN-dominated phase, then evolving towards a local elliptical. On the other hand, moderately star-forming galaxies containing a low-luminosity AGN have various properties suggesting they are good candidates for systems in a transition phase preceding the formation of steady spiral galaxies.},

	abstract = {The 60-micron luminosity function for galaxies detected by IRAS is determined from a compilation of samples with highly complete redshift information totalling 2818 galaxies, including the new QMC-Cambridge-Durham survey and samples include many nearby, low-luminosity galaxies. We use clustering-independent maxi likelihood methods throughout. A non-parametric estimator is used to determined shape of the luminosity function, and the best parameter set found for a suitable analytic form. We find the luminosity function to be well described by a Gaussian dependence on log(luminosity), changing over to a very flat power law at low luminosities: this latter feature is in strong contrast to previous results. We find results to be very insensitive to various models for deviations from the Hubble flow and to different values of the Hubble constant. We present a generalization of the non-parametric estimator for determination of the bivariate luminosity function of samples defined by two flux limits. We apply this to two optically + 60-micron limited samples containing relatively large numbers of low-luminosity galaxies and confirm the flatness of the luminosity function at this end. The joint luminosity function suggests simple forms for the distribution of 60-micron luminosity versus blue luminosity and linear diameter, and we determine maximum likelihood solutions for these forms. In addition, we determine the 40-120 micron far-infrared luminosity function, and derive separate 60-micron luminosity function for the normal and starburst populations, as classified by far-infrared temperature. We also present a new method for finding the run of density against distance for any flux and/or magnitude limited sample, independent of any assumptions on the shape of the luminosity function. Large local overdensities are found, confirming the existence of bias in previous work. This method forms an excellent indicator for evolution, and strong evolution [luminosity is proportional to (1 + z){\textasciicircum}3+/-1{\textasciicircum} or density is proportional to (1 + z){\textasciicircum}7+/-2{\textasciicircum}] is seen in the QCD survey. The combination of luminosity function and density estimator allows us to investigate the internal consistency of our results, and we find no evidence that systematic errors outweigh the statistical uncertainties.},

Using z {\textless} 0.1 bivariate distributions as a reference we model the higher-z distributions, thereby approximating a correction for the missing optically faint star-forming galaxies to the local star formation rate (SFR) and M densities. Furthermore, we obtain the r-band luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions of Hα star-forming galaxies from the bivariate LFs. As our sample is selected on the basis of detected Hα emission, a direct tracer of ongoing star formation, this sample represents a true star-forming galaxy sample, and is drawn from both photometrically classified blue and red subpopulations, though mostly from the blue population.

	abstract = {Recently a population of large, very low surface brightness, spheroidal galaxies was identified in the Coma cluster. The apparent survival of these ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in a rich cluster suggests that they have very high masses. Here, we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the largest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope. We find a velocity dispersion of σ =\{47\}-6+8 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1, which implies a dynamical mass of \{M\}\{dyn\}({\textless} \{r\}1/2)=\{0.7\}-0.2+0.3× \{10\}10 \{M\}⊙ within its deprojected half-light radius of \{r\}1/2=4.6+/- 0.2 \{kpc\}. The mass-to-light ratio is M/\{L\}I({\textless} \{r\}1/2)=\{48\}-14+21 \{M\}⊙ /\{L\}⊙ , and the dark matter fraction is 98\% within \{r\}1/2. The high mass of Dragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population. From deep Gemini imaging taken in 0{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} 4 seeing we infer that Dragonfly 44 has \{94\}-20+25 globular clusters, similar to the counts for other galaxies in this mass range. Our results add to other recent evidence that many UDGs are “failed” galaxies, with the sizes, dark matter content, and globular cluster systems of much more luminous objects. We estimate the total dark halo mass of Dragonfly 44 by comparing the amount of dark matter within r=4.6 \{kpc\} to enclosed mass profiles of NFW halos. The enclosed mass suggests a total mass of ∼ \{10\}12 \{M\}⊙ , similar to the mass of the Milky Way. The existence of nearly dark objects with this mass is unexpected, as galaxy formation is thought to be maximally efficient in this regime.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of 854 ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster using deep R band images, with partial B, i, and Hα band coverage, obtained with the Subaru telescope. Many of them (332) are Milky Way (MW) sized with very large effective radii of \{r\}\{e\} 1.5 \{kpc\}. This study was motivated by the recent discovery of 47 UDGs by Dokkum et al.; our discovery suggests 1000 UDGs after accounting for the smaller Subaru field (4.1 \{\{degree\}\}2; about one-half of Dragonfly). The new Subaru UDGs show a distribution concentrated around the cluster center, strongly suggesting that the great majority are (likely longtime) cluster members. They are a passively evolving population, lying along the red sequence in the color-magnitude diagram with no signature of Hα emission. Star formation was, therefore, quenched in the past. They have exponential light profiles, effective radii \{r\}\{e\}∼ 800{\textbackslash}\{pc\}-5 \{kpc\}, effective surface brightnesses \{μ \}\{e\}(\{{\textbackslash}text\{\}\}R) = 25-28 mag arcsec-2, and stellar masses ∼ 1× \{10\}7\{{\textbackslash}text\{\}\}\{M\}⊙ -5× \{10\}8\{{\textbackslash}text\{\}\}\{M\}⊙ . There is also a population of nucleated UDGs. Some MW-sized UDGs appear closer to the cluster center than previously reported; their survival in the strong tidal field, despite their large sizes, possibly indicates a large dark matter fraction protecting the diffuse stellar component. The indicated baryon fraction ≲ 1\% is less than the cosmic average, and thus the gas must have been removed (from the possibly massive dark halo). The UDG population is elevated in the Coma cluster compared to the field, indicating that the gas removal mechanism is related primarily to the cluster environment.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of 47 low surface brightness objects in deep images of a 3° × 3° field centered on the Coma cluster, obtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. The objects have central surface brightness μ(g, 0) ranging from 24-26 mag arcsec-2 and effective radii r eff = 3''-10'', as measured from archival Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope images. From their spatial distribution we infer that most or all of the objects are galaxies in the Coma cluster. This relatively large distance is surprising as it implies that the galaxies are very large: with r eff = 1.5-4.6 kpc their sizes are similar to those of L * galaxies even though their median stellar mass is only {\textasciitilde}6 × 107 M ⊙. The galaxies are relatively red and round, with langg - irang = 0.8 and langb/arang = 0.74. One of the 47 galaxies is fortuitously covered by a deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) observation. The ACS imaging shows a large spheroidal object with a central surface brightness μ475 = 25.8 mag arcsec-2, a Sérsic index n = 0.6, and an effective radius of 7'', corresponding to 3.4 kpc at the distance of Coma. The galaxy is not resolved into stars, consistent with expectations for a Coma cluster object. We speculate that these "ultra-diffuse galaxies" may have lost their gas supply at early times, possibly resulting in very high dark matter fractions.},

Here, we report the structural properties of five UDGs in the Perseus cluster based on deep Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging. Three appear GC-poor and two appear GC-rich. One of our sample, PUDG\_R24, appears to be undergoing quenching and is expected to fade into the UDG regime within the next {\textasciitilde}0.5 Gyr. We target this sample with Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectroscopy to investigate differences in their dark matter haloes, as expected from their differing GC content. Our spectroscopy measures both recessional velocities, confirming Perseus cluster membership, and stellar velocity dispersions, to measure dynamical masses within their half-light radius. We supplement our data with that from the literature to examine trends in galaxy parameters with GC system richness. We do not find the correlation between GC numbers and UDG phase space positioning expected if GC-rich UDGs environmentally quench at high redshift. We do find GC-rich UDGs to have higher velocity dispersions than GC-poor UDGs on average, resulting in greater dynamical mass within the half-light radius. This agrees with the first order expectation that GC-rich UDGs have higher halo masses than GC-poor UDGs.},

The redshifts are assumed to be cosmological. The distribution in space is found to be strongly non-uniform. The space density, in co-moving coordinates, is increasing with redshift z, such that at z = 1 the density is around 150 and 80 times the local (z = 0) density, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. This density increase corresponds to a N(S) relation quite {\textasciitilde}imi1ar to that exhibited by extragalactic radio sources. The optical luminosity function is relatively flat, i e., the numbers per magnitude depend little on the luminosity In contrast the radio luminosity function is rather steep, the number per magnitude increas- ing toward fainter radio luminosities by a factor of around three to four per magnitude. Extension of this radio luminosity function by 1{\textasciitilde} magnitude is sufficient to account for the Sandage-Luyten estimate of the sky density of quasi-stellar objects. The local (z = 0) density of quasi-stellar objects can then be estimated at 7 X 1O{\textasciitilde} and 12 X 1O-{\textasciitilde} Mpc3, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) COSMOS radio observations at 3 GHz to infer radio luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies up to redshifts of z 5 based on approximately 6000 detections with reliable optical counterparts. This is currently the largest radio-selected sample available out to z 5 across an area of 2 square degrees with a sensitivity of rms ≈ 2.3 μJy beam-1. By fixing the faint and bright end shape of the radio luminosity function to the local values, we find a strong redshift trend that can be fitted with a pure luminosity evolution L1.4 GHz ∝ (1 + z)(3.16 ± 0.2)-(0.32 ± 0.07)z. We estimate star formation rates (SFRs) from our radio luminosities using an infrared (IR)-radio correlation that is redshift dependent. By integrating the parametric fits of the evolved luminosity function we calculate the cosmic SFR density (SFRD) history since z 5. Our data suggest that the SFRD history peaks between 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 3 and that the ultraluminous infrared galaxies (100 M⊙ yr-1 {\textless} SFR {\textless} 1000 M⊙ yr-1) contribute up to 25\% to the total SFRD in the same redshift range. Hyperluminous infrared galaxies (SFR {\textgreater} 1000 M⊙ yr-1) contribute an additional ≲2\% in the entire observed redshift range. We find evidence of a potential underestimation of SFRD based on ultraviolet (UV) rest-frame observations of Lyman break galaxies at high redshifts (z ≳ 4) on the order of 15-20\%, owing to appreciable star formation in highly dust-obscured galaxies, which might remain undetected in such UV observations.},

	abstract = {Powerful radio sources associated with supermassive black holes are among the most luminous objects in the universe, and are frequently recognized both as cosmological probes and active constituents in the evolution of galaxies. We present alignments between radio jets and cold molecular gas in the environment of distant radio galaxies, and show that the brightness of the radio synchrotron source can be enhanced by its interplay with the molecular gas. Our work is based on CO J {\textgreater} 1 observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of three radio galaxies with redshifts in the range 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.1, namely MRC 0114-211 (z = 1.41), MRC 0156-252 (z = 2.02), and MRC 2048-272 (z = 2.05). These ALMA observations support previous work that found molecular gas out to 50 kpc in the circumgalactic environment, based on a CO(1–0) survey performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The CO emission is found along the radio axes but beyond the main radio lobes. When compared to a large sample of high-z radio galaxies from the literature, we find that the presence of this cold molecular medium correlates with an increased flux-density ratio of the main versus counter-lobe. This suggest that the radio lobe brightens when encountering cold molecular gas in the environment. While part of the molecular gas is likely related to the interstellar medium from either the host or a companion galaxy, a significant fraction of the molecular gas in these systems shows very low excitation, with r 2−1/1−0 and r 3−2/1−0 values ≲0.2. This could be part of the circumgalactic medium.},

We constrained the evolution of this population via continuous models of pure density and pure luminosity evolutions, and we found best-fit parametrizations of Φ∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.00 ± 0.18) - (0.60 ± 0.14)z, and L∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.88 ± 0.82) - (0.84 ± 0.34)z, respectively, with a turnover in number and luminosity densities of the population at z ≈ 1.5. We converted 1.4 GHz luminosity to kinetic luminosity taking uncertainties of the scaling relation used into account. We thereby derived the cosmic evolution of the kinetic luminosity density provided by the AGN and compared this luminosity density to the radio-mode AGN feedback assumed in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) model, I.e., to the redshift evolution of the central supermassive black hole accretion luminosity taken in the model as the source of heating that offsets the energy losses of the cooling, hot halo gas, and thereby limits further stellar mass growth of massive galaxies. We find that the kinetic luminosity exerted by our radio AGN may be high enough to balance the radiative cooling of the hot gas at each cosmic epoch since z 5. However, although our findings support the idea of radio-mode AGN feedback as a cosmologically relevant process in massive galaxy formation, many simplifications in both the observational and semi-analytic approaches still remain and need to be resolved before robust conclusions can be reached.},

We search for large, extended molecular gas reservoirs among 46 previously detected CO(1-0) emitters, employing a customised method we developed. Based on the CO emission images and position-velocity diagrams, as well as the ranking of sources using a binary weighting of six different criteria, we have identified 14 robust and 7 tentative candidates that exhibit large extended molecular gas reservoirs. These extended reservoirs are defined as having sizes greater than 40 kpc or super-galactic scale. This result suggests a high frequency of extended gas reservoirs, comprising at least {\textbackslash}(30 {\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}) of our CO-selected sample. An environmental study of the candidates is carried out based on N-th nearest neighbour and we find that the large molecular gas reservoirs tend to exist in denser regions. The spatial distribution of our candidates is mainly centred on the core region of the Spiderweb protocluster. The performance and adaptability of our method are discussed. We found 13 (potentially) extended gas reservoirs located in nine galaxy (proto)clusters from the literature. We noticed that large extended molecular gas reservoirs surrounding (normal) star-forming galaxies in protoclusters are rare. This may be attributable to the lack of observations low-J CO transitions and the lack of quantitative analyses of molecular gas morphologies. The large gas reservoirs in the Spiderweb protocluster are a potential source of the intracluster medium seen in low redshift Virgo- or Coma-like galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Qz, which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 σ scatter in Δ z/(1 + z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

	abstract = {Recent works have suggested that energy balance spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes may be of limited use for studying high-redshift galaxies for which the observed ultraviolet and far-infrared emission are offset (spatially ‘decoupled’). It has been proposed that such offsets could lead energy balance codes to miscalculate the overall energetics, preventing them from recovering such galaxies’ true properties. In this work, we test how well the SED fitting code magphys can recover the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, dust mass, and luminosity by fitting 6706 synthetic SEDs generated from four zoom-in simulations of dusty, high-redshift galaxies from the FIRE project via dust continuum radiative transfer. Comparing our panchromatic results (using wavelengths 0.4–500 μm, and spanning 1 \&lt; z \&lt; 8) with fits based on either the starlight (\${\textbackslash}lambda \_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\} {\textbackslash}le 2.2{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu\$m) or dust (\${\textbackslash}ge 100{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu\$m) alone, we highlight the power of considering the full range of multiwavelength data alongside an energy balance criterion. Overall, we obtain acceptable fits for 83 per cent of the synthetic SEDs, though the success rate falls rapidly beyond z ≈ 4, in part due to the sparser sampling of the priors at earlier times since SFHs must be physically plausible (i.e. shorter than the age of the universe). We use the ground truth from the simulations to show that when the quality of fit is acceptable, the fidelity of magphys estimates is independent of the degree of UV/FIR offset, with performance very similar to that previously reported for local galaxies.},

	abstract = {The distribution in space and both the optical and radio luminosity functions of quasi-stellar radio sources are derived The derivation is based on quasi-stellar sources in the Revised 3C Catalogue, in which they have been identified and observed with a high degree of completeness down to magnitude around 18k. The redshifts are assumed to be cosmological. The distribution in space is found to be strongly non-uniform. The space density, in co-moving coordinates, is increasing with redshift z, such that at z = 1 the density is around 150 and 80 times the local (z = 0) density, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. This density increase corresponds to a N(S) relation quite {\textasciitilde}imi1ar to that exhibited by extragalactic radio sources. The optical luminosity function is relatively flat, i e., the numbers per magnitude depend little on the luminosity In contrast the radio luminosity function is rather steep, the number per magnitude increas- ing toward fainter radio luminosities by a factor of around three to four per magnitude. Extension of this radio luminosity function by 1{\textasciitilde} magnitude is sufficient to account for the Sandage-Luyten estimate of the sky density of quasi-stellar objects. The local (z = 0) density of quasi-stellar objects can then be estimated at 7 X 1O{\textasciitilde} and 12 X 1O-{\textasciitilde} Mpc3, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. Unpublished spectra and redshifts of quasi-stellar sources are given in the Appendix},

	abstract = {Aims: Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. Methods: For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale \& Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. Results: For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 μm, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 Å, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 1011 M⊙ towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. Conclusions: The results for our SINGS test sample demonstrate that CIGALE can be a valuable tool for studying basic properties of galaxies in the near and distant Universe if UV-to-IR data are available.},

	abstract = {We study two galaxies samples selected in near-ultraviolet (NUV) and in far-infrared (FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far-UV (FUV) to the FIR are available. We compared the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus burst) and dust attenuation laws (power law + 2175 Åbump). The Bayesian method allows one to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from SED analysis if the FIR information is not used. The dispersion is larger than with the FIR data. The distribution is also not symmetrically distributed about zero: there is an overestimation for UV-selected galaxies and an underestimation for FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud extinction law while FIR-selected galaxies attenuation laws resemble more the Milky Way extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the log (Fdust/FFUV) versus FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV - NUV accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameters b0 for UV-selected galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for UV galaxies only (that should only be used whenever the FIR information is not available because the resulting AFUV is poorly defined with an uncertainty of about 0.32): AFUV= 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)2+ 0.3298 (NUV-I)2+ 2.1207 (FUV-NUV) + 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408.},

A supplementary source catalog is also provided, including 47 lower-significance sources that have bright (\{K\}s≤slant 23) near-infrared counterparts. We identify multiwavelength counterparts for 992 (98.4\%) of the main-catalog sources, and we collect redshifts for 986 of these sources, including 653 spectroscopic redshifts and 333 photometric redshifts. Based on the X-ray and multiwavelength properties, we identify 711 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the main-catalog sources. Compared to the previous ≈4 Ms CDF-S catalogs, 291 of the main-catalog sources are new detections. We have achieved unprecedented X-ray sensitivity with average flux limits over the central ≈1 arcmin2 region of ≈1.9 × 10-17, 6.4 × 10-18, and 2.7 × 10-17 erg cm-2 s-1 in the three X-ray bands, respectively. We provide cumulative number-count measurements observing, for the first time, that normal galaxies start to dominate the X-ray source population at the faintest 0.5-2.0 keV flux levels.

	abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven-year sky survey which began in 2005 May. UKIDSS is being carried out using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has the largest étendue of any infrared astronomical instrument to date. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000deg2 to a depth of K {\textasciitilde} 18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35deg2 to K {\textasciitilde} 21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77deg2 to K {\textasciitilde} 23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long-term astronomical legacy data base; the design is, however, driven by a series of specific goals - for example, to find the nearest and faintest substellar objects, to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist, to determine the substellar mass function, to break the z = 7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionization, to measure the growth of structure from z = 3 to the present day, to determine the epoch of spheroid formation, and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed. Images and catalogues are being made available through a fully queryable user interface - the WFCAM Science Archive (http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). The data are being released in stages. The data are immediately public to astronomers in all ESO member states, and available to the world after 18 months. Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortia collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release, we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposure of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS), using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Eleven individual pointings made between 1999 October and 2000 December were combined to generate the final image used for object detection. Catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two different methods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the SExtractor algorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for Chandra observations. The detection threshold has been set in order to have less than 10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. We subdivided the catalog into four sections. The primary list consists of objects common to the two detection methods. Two secondary lists contain sources which were detected by (1) the SExtractor algorithm alone and (2) the wavelet technique alone. The fourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. The flux limits at the aimpoint for the soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) bands are 5.5×10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 and 4.5×10-16 erg s-1 cm-2, respectively. The total number of sources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5-2 keV band, and 251 in the 2-10 keV band. We also present optical identifications for the cataloged sources. Our primary optical data are R band imaging from VLT/FORS1 to a depth of R{\textasciitilde}26.5 (Vega). In regions of the field not covered by the VLT/FORS1 deep imaging, we use R-band data obtained with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the ESO-MPI 2.2 m telescope, as part of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS), which cover the entire X-ray survey. We found that the FORS1/Chandra offsets are small, {\textasciitilde}1". Coordinate cross-correlation finds 85\% of the Chandra sources covered by FORS1 R to have counterparts within the 3 σ error box ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1.5" depending on off-axis angle and X-ray signal-to-noise). The unidentified fraction of sources, approximately {\textasciitilde}10\%-15\%, is close to the limit expected from the observed X-ray flux to R-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.},

	abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) and star formation rate (SFR) for Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-mass progenitors from z = 0.2 to 2.5. We source galaxies from the Ks-band-selected ZFOURGE survey, which includes multiwavelength data spanning 0.3-160 μm. We use decomposition software to split the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our galaxies into their active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star-forming components, which allows us to estimate BHARs and SFRs from the infrared (IR). We perform tests to check the robustness of these estimates, including a comparison with BHARs and SFRs derived from X-ray stacking and far-IR analysis, respectively. We find that, as the progenitors evolve their relative black hole-galaxy growth (i.e. their BHAR/SFR ratio) increases from low to high redshift. The MW-mass progenitors exhibit a log-log slope of 0.64 ± 0.11, while the M31-mass progenitors are 0.39 ± 0.08. This result contrasts with previous studies that find an almost flat slope when adopting X-ray-/AGN-selected or mass-limited samples and is likely due to their use of a broad mixture of galaxies with different evolutionary histories. Our use of progenitor-matched samples highlights the potential importance of carefully selecting progenitors when searching for evolutionary relationships between BHAR/SFRs. Additionally, our finding that BHAR/SFR ratios do not track the rate at which progenitors quench casts doubts over the idea that the suppression of star formation is predominantly driven by luminous AGN feedback (i.e. high BHARs).},

	abstract = {We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates within the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) to determine the impact they have on star formation in their host galaxies. We first identify a population of radio, X-ray, and infrared-selected AGN by cross-matching the deep Ks-band imaging of ZFOURGE with overlapping multiwavelength data. From this, we construct a mass-complete (log(M\_\{\{*\}\}/M\_\{\{⊙\}\}) ≥9.75), AGN luminosity limited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2-3.2. We compare the rest-frame U - V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the AGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using 160 μm Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star formation rate of AGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34 ± 0.07 dex with respect to the control sample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by infrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much as a factor of ∼5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and postulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating galaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.},

	abstract = {We present the J-band luminosity function (LF) of 1838 mid-infrared and X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.85. These LFs are constructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broadband observations from the UV to the mid-IR of the NDWFS Boötes field with the X-ray observations of the XBoötes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field by AGES. Our sample is primarily composed of IRAC-selected AGNs, targeted using modifications of the Stern et al. criteria, complemented by MIPS 24 μm and X-ray-selected AGNs to alleviate the biases of IRAC mid-IR selection against z {\textasciitilde} 4.5 quasars and AGNs faint with respect to their hosts. This sample provides an accurate link between low- and high-redshift AGN LFs and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness of optical samples at z {\textasciitilde} 3. We use a set of low-resolution spectral energy distribution templates for AGNs and galaxies presented in a previous paper by Assef et al. to model the selection function of these sources and apply host and reddening corrections. We find that the space density of the brightest quasars strongly decreases from z = 3 to z = 0, while the space density of faint quasars is at least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. At z{\textgreater}3, we observe a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. We model the LF by a double power law and find that its evolution cannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, but must be a combination of both. We used the bright-end slope determined by Croom et al. (2QZ) as a prior to fit the data in order to minimize the effects of our small survey area. The bright-end power-law index of our best-fit model remains consistent with the prior, while the best-fit faint-end index is consistent with the low-redshift measurements based on the 2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys. Our best-fit model generally agrees with the number of bright quasars predicted by other LFs at all redshifts. If we construct the QSO luminosity function using only the IRAC-selected AGNs, we find that the biases inherent to this selection method significantly modify the behavior of the characteristic density phi*(z) only for z {\textless} 1 and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude M *,J (z).},

The well defined IRAC samples contain 3800-5800 galaxies for the 3.6-8.0 μm bands with spectroscopic redshifts and z {\textless} 0.6. We obtained relatively complete luminosity functions in the local redshift bin of z {\textless} 0.2 for all four IRAC channels that are well fitted by Schechter functions. After analyzing the samples for the whole redshift range, we found significant evolution in the luminosity functions for all four IRAC channels that can be fitted as an evolution in M * with redshift, ΔM * = Qz. While we measured Q = 1.2 ± 0.4 and 1.1 ± 0.4 in the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands consistent with the predictions from a passively evolving population, we obtained Q = 1.8 ± 1.1 in the 8.0 μm band consistent with other evolving star formation rate estimates. We compared our luminosity functions with the predictions of semianalytical galaxy formation and found the best agreement at 3.6 and 4.5 μm, rough agreement at 8.0 μm, and a large mismatch at 5.8 μm. These models also predicted a comparable Q-value to our luminosity functions at 8.0 μm, but predicted smaller values at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We also measured the luminosity functions separately for early- and late-type galaxies. While the luminosity functions of late-type galaxies resemble those for the total population, the luminosity functions of early-type galaxies in the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands indicate deviations from the passive evolution model, especially from the measured flat luminosity density evolution. Combining our estimates with other measurements in the literature, we found 53 ± 18\% of the present stellar mass of early-type galaxies was assembled at z = 0.7.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]λ5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hδ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

In addition, we present a compilation of ultraviolet, infrared and H α SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z {\textless} 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic star formation rates (SFRs) for z ∼ 0-8 as well. We demonstrate that supernovae feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR ∼1-10 M⊙ yr-1 dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z ≤ 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR ∼10-100 M⊙ yr-1) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (z ∼ 2) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR ∼10-100 M⊙ yr-1 would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively rare high-mass haloes (MHalo ∼ 1011-13 M⊙) even at the earliest epochs.},

The composite X-ray to IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGNs, which are used to compare the hard X-ray LF (HXLF) and the IRLF, are modelled with a simple, but well-tested torus model, based on the radiative transfer and photoionization code, CLOUDY. Four observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10 keV HXLF and six evolution models of the obscured type 2 AGN fraction (f2) are considered. The 8.0- and 15-?m LFs for unobscured type 1, obscured type 2 and all AGNs are predicted from the HXLFs, and then compared with the measurements currently available. We find that the IRLFs predicted from the HXLFs tend to underestimate the number of the most IR-luminous AGNs. This is independent of the choices of HXLF and f2, and this is even more obvious for the HXLFs recently measured. We show that the discrepancy between the HXLFs and IRLFs can be largely resolved when the anticorrelation between the ultraviolet (UV) to X-ray slope αox and UV luminosity LUV is appropriately considered. We also discuss other possible explanations for the discrepancy, such as the missing population of Compton-thick AGNs and the possible contribution of star formation in the host to the mid-IR. Meanwhile, we find that the HXLFs and IRLFs of AGNs might be more consistent with each other if the obscuration mechanisms of quasars and Seyferts are assumed to be different, corresponding to their different triggering and fuelling mechanisms. In order to clarify these interesting issues, it would be very helpful to obtain more accurate measurements of the IRLFs of AGNs, especially those determined at smaller redshift bins, and to more accurately separate the measurements for type 1 and type 2 AGNs.},

	abstract = {Context. Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their spectral energy distribution (SED). Aims: We present a completely new implementation of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE). Written in python, its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities. Methods: To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution. Results: CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications.

	abstract = {The detection of X-ray emission constitutes a reliable and efficient tool for the selection of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), although it may be biased against the most heavily absorbed AGNs. Simple mid-infrared (IR) broad-band selection criteria identify a large number of luminous and absorbed AGNs, yet again host contamination could lead to non-uniform and incomplete samples. Spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition is able to decouple the emission from the AGN versus that from star-forming regions, revealing weaker AGN components. We aim to identify the obscured AGN population in the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey in the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey W1 field through SED modelling. We construct SEDs for 6860 sources and identify 160 AGNs at a high confidence level using a Bayesian approach. Using optical spectroscopy, we confirm the nature of ∼85 per cent of the AGNs. Our AGN sample is highly complete (∼92 per cent) compared to mid-IR colour-selected AGNs, including a significant number of galaxy-dominated systems with lower luminosities. In addition to the lack of X-ray emission (80 per cent), the SED fitting results suggest that the majority of the sources are obscured. We use a number of diagnostic criteria in the optical, IR, and X-ray regimes to verify these results. Interestingly, only 35 per cent of the most luminous mid-IR-selected AGNs have X-ray counterparts suggesting strong absorption. Our work emphasizes the importance of using SED decomposition techniques to select a population of type II AGNs, which may remain undetected by either X-ray or IR colour surveys.},

First, spectral decomposition is carried out by adopting the Bayesian exchange Monte Carlo method for various artificial spectral data, and the confidence interval of fitting parameters is evaluated. From the results, an approximated model formula that expresses the confidence interval of parameters and the relationship between the peak-to-peak distance and the signal-to-noise ratio is derived. Next, for real spectral data, we compare the confidence interval of each peak parameter obtained using the Bayesian exchange Monte Carlo method with the confidence interval obtained from the BIC-fitting with the model selection function and the proposed approximated formula. We thus confirm that the parameter confidence intervals obtained using the two methods agree well. It is therefore possible to not only simply estimate the appropriate number of peaks by BIC-fitting but also obtain the confidence interval of fitting parameters.},

	abstract = {The spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies is a complex function of the star formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas in galaxies. The computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiation through the dust distribution is time-consuming. This aspect becomes unacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analytical galaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then compared with multi-wavelength surveys. Mainly for this aim, we have implemented an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiative transfer code grasil in order to compute the SED of galaxies in a short computing time. This allows to avoid the adoption of empirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies output by models. The ANN has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum (the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-forming molecular clouds (MC) and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties and dependencies). We have defined the input neurons effectively determining their emission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and is not linked to a particular galaxy formation model. We have trained the net for the disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce the SED of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model for spheroidal galaxies. We have checked that for this model both the SEDs and the galaxy counts in the Herschel bands obtained with the ANN approximation are almost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full grasil. We conclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present the application to a more complex SAM in another paper.},

However, modern ground-based surveys now probe volumes large enough to discover AGNs at depths sensitive enough for fainter galaxies, bridging these two populations. Using these observations as constraints, we present a methodology to empirically jointly model the evolution of the rest-UV LFs at z = 3–9. Our critical assumptions are that both populations have LFs well described by double power laws modified to allow for a flattening at the faint-end, and that all LF parameters evolve smoothly with redshift. This methodology provides a good fit to the observations and makes predictions to volume densities not yet observed, finding that the volume density of bright (M UV = −28) AGNs rises by ∼105 from z = 9 to z = 3, while bright (M UV = −21) star-forming galaxies rise by only ∼102 across the same epoch. The observed bright-end flattening of the z = 9 LF is unlikely to be due to AGN activity, and rather is due to a shallowing of the bright-end slope, implying a reduction of feedback in bright galaxies at early times. The intrinsic ionizing emissivity is dominated by star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3, even after applying a notional escape fraction. We find decent agreement between our AGN LFs and predictions based on different black hole seeding models, though all models underpredict the observed abundance of bright AGNs. We show that the wide-area surveys of the upcoming Euclid and Roman observatories should be capable of discovering AGNs to z ∼ 8.},

We infer galaxy properties with two SED modelling codes and compare results, finding that stellar masses are largely insensitive to the model, but the inferred ages can vary by an order of magnitude. We infer a distribution of ages assuming a simple, parametric SFH model, finding a median age of {\textasciitilde}30-70 Myr depending on SED model. We quantify the fractions of ≤10 and ≥250 Myr galaxies, finding that these systems comprise {\textasciitilde}15-30 per cent and {\textasciitilde}20-25 per cent of the population, respectively. With a flexible SFH model, the shapes of the SFHs are consistent with those implied by the simple model (e.g. young galaxies have rapidly rising SFHs). However, stellar masses can differ significantly, with those of young systems sometimes being more than an order of magnitude larger with the flexible SFH. We quantify the implications of these results for z ≳ 9 stellar mass assembly and discuss improvements expected from JWST.},

Simple expressions are derived that relate supermassive black hole growth, star formation, and outflow rates.

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive synthesis model for the active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution and the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Universe. We assume that black holes accrete in just three distinct physical states, or `modes': at low Eddington ratio, only a radiatively inefficient, kinetically dominated mode is allowed [low kinetic (LK)] at high Eddington ratio, instead, AGN may display both a purely radiative [radio quiet, high radiative (HR)] and a kinetic [radio loud, high kinetic (HK)] mode. We solve the continuity equation for the black hole mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary condition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth rate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric correction and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous semi-analytic and numerical models for black hole growth, we do not assume any specific distribution of Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass and luminosity functions and a set of fundamental relations between observables in the three accretion modes. SMBH always show a very broad accretion rate distribution, and we discuss the profound consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed AGN fractions in galaxies, as well as for the empirical determination of SMBH mass functions with large surveys. We confirm previous results and clearly demonstrate that, at least for z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1.5, SMBH mass function evolves antihierarchically, i.e. the most massive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first time, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts above the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z {\textasciitilde} 2). We also derive tight constraints on the (mass-weighted) average radiative efficiency of AGN: under the simplifying assumption that the mass density of both high redshift (z {\textasciitilde} 5) and `wandering' black holes ejected from galactic nuclei after merger events are negligible compared to the local mass density, we find that 0.065 {\textless} ξ0{\textless}ɛrad{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.07, where ξ0 is the local SMBH mass density in units of 4.3 × 105MsolarMpc-3. We trace the cosmological evolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and find that the overall efficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest mass energy into kinetic power, ɛkin, ranges between ɛkin {\textasciitilde}= (3-5) × 10-3, depending on the choice of the radio core luminosity function. Such a `kinetic efficiency' varies however strongly with SMBH mass and redshift, being maximal for very massive holes at late times, as required for the AGN feedback by many galaxy formation models in cosmological contexts.},

Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

	abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0-6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z {\textasciitilde} 0.2-2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of {\textasciitilde}L* gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z gtrsim 1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas and investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. We present new IRAM PdBI CO(1-0) observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasar-hosts: a clear signature of massive and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of several 100 M⊙ yr-1. We combine these new observations with data from the literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their star formation rate (SFR), or even higher by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which is found to increase with the LAGN/Lbol ratio. The gas depletion time scales due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in starburst galaxies down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts, the depletion time scales due to the outflow are much shorter than the depletion time scales due to star formation. We estimate the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it corresponds to about 5\% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 LAGN/c are common among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For "pure" starburst galaxies, our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds. Overall, our results indicate that, although starbursts are effective in powering massive molecular outflows, the presence of an AGN may strongly enhance such outflows, and therefore have a profound feedback effect on the evolution of galaxies by efficiently removing fuel for star formation, hence quenching star formation.

	abstract = {A major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is the inclusion of so-called active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The energy input from an active central massive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies at later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and compelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In search for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16000 early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data base (MOSES: Morphologically Selected Ellipticals in SDSS). Key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion through visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against recent star formation and nuclear activity. Based on the nebular emission-line characteristics we separate between star formation activity, black hole activity, the composite of the two and quiescence. We find that emission is mostly LINER (low ionization nuclear emission line region) like in high-mass galaxies (σ {\textgreater} 200kms-1) and roughly evenly distributed between star formation and AGN at intermediate and low (σ {\textless} 100kms-1) masses. The objects with emission ({\textasciitilde}20 per cent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the colour-mass diagram. Star-forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while early-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red sequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two extremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel method that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) and stellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the red sequence star formation occurred several 100Myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from star formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process lasts about 1Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the starburst. The most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressed by nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence. This is empirical evidence for the occurrence of AGN feedback in early-type galaxies at recent epochs.},

Here we investigate the relationship between BH mass and host galaxy total stellar mass using a sample of 262 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the nearby universe (z {\textless} 0.055), as well as 79 galaxies with dynamical BH masses. The vast majority of our AGN sample is constructed using Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and searching for Seyfert-like narrow-line ratios and broad Hα emission. BH masses are estimated using standard virial techniques. We also include a small number of dwarf galaxies with total stellar masses Mstellar ≲ 109.5 M⊙ and a subsample of the reverberation-mapped AGNs. Total stellar masses of all 341 galaxies are calculated in the most consistent manner feasible using color-dependent mass-to-light ratios. We find a clear correlation between BH mass and total stellar mass for the AGN host galaxies, with MBH ∝ Mstellar, similar to that of early-type galaxies with dynamically detected BHs. However, the relation defined by the AGNs has a normalization that is lower by more than an order of magnitude, with a BH-to-total stellar mass fraction of MBH/Mstellar ∼ 0.025\% across the stellar mass range 108 ≤ Mstellar/M⊙ ≤ 1012. This result has significant implications for studies at high redshift and cosmological simulations in which stellar bulges cannot be resolved.},

The key ingredients of the simulations are gas, stars, black holes (BHs), self-gravity, star formation and stellar feedback (via a subgrid model); BH feedback is not included. We use {\textasciitilde}100 simulations to survey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the interstellar medium physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic nuclei ({\textless}{\textasciitilde} 300pc) using galaxy-scale simulations, including both major galaxy mergers and isolated bar-(un)stable disc galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems, we find that a series of gravitational instabilities generates large accretion rates of up to {\textasciitilde} 1-10 Msolar yr-1 on to the BH (i.e. at {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1pc) this is comparable to what is needed to fuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable for a given set of conditions in the galaxy at {\textasciitilde}kpc. At radii of {\textgreater}rsim 10 pc, our simulations resemble the `bars-within-bars' model of Shlosman et al., but we show that the gas can have a diverse array of morphologies, including spirals, rings, clumps and bars; the duty cycle of these features is modest, complicating attempts to correlate BH accretion with the morphology of gas in galactic nuclei. At {\textasciitilde} 1-10 pc, the gravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no longer present. However, we show that the gas can become unstable to a standing, eccentric disc or a single-armed spiral mode (m = 1), in which the stars and gas precess at different rates, driving the gas to sub-pc scales (again for sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems). A proper treatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity of both the stars and gas (which has not been the case in many previous calculations). Our simulations predict a correlation between the BH accretion rate and the star formation rate at different galactic radii. We find that nuclear star formation is more tightly coupled to active galactic nucleus activity than the global star formation rate of a galaxy, but a reasonable correlation remains even for the latter.},

	abstract = {Context. Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is often identified as the main mechanism responsible for regulating star formation in active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies. However, the relationships between AGN activity, radiation, winds, and star formation are complex and still far from being understood. Aims: We study scaling relations between AGN properties, host galaxy properties, and AGN winds. We then evaluate the wind mean impact on the global star formation history, taking into account the short AGN duty cycle with respect to that of star formation. Methods: We first collect AGN wind observations for 94 AGN with detected massive winds at sub-pc to kpc spatial scales. We then fold AGN wind scaling relations with AGN luminosity functions, to evaluate the average AGN wind mass-loading factor as a function of cosmic time. Results: We find strong correlations between the AGN molecular and ionised wind mass outflow rates and the AGN bolometric luminosity. The power law scaling is steeper for ionised winds (slope 1.29 ± 0.38) than for molecular winds (0.76 ± 0.06), meaning that the two rates converge at high bolometric luminosities. The molecular gas depletion timescale and the molecular gas fraction of galaxies hosting powerful AGN driven winds are 3-10 times shorter and smaller than those of main sequence galaxies with similar star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and redshift. These findings suggest that, at high AGN bolometric luminosity, the reduced molecular gas fraction may be due to the destruction of molecules by the wind, leading to a larger fraction of gas in the atomic ionised phase. The AGN wind mass-loading factor η = ṀOF/SFR is systematically higher than that of starburst driven winds. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that AGN winds are, on average, powerful enough to clean galaxies from their molecular gas only in massive systems at z ≲ 2, I.e. a strong form of co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies appears to break down for the least massive galaxies.},

	abstract = {We use a coupled model of the formation and evolution of galaxies and black holes (BHs) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a cold dark matter universe. The model is embedded in the galaxy formation code GALFORM and predicts the masses, spins and mass accretion histories of BHs in tandem with the formation of their host galaxies. BHs grow by accretion during starbursts, triggered by discs becoming dynamically unstable or by galaxy mergers, and accretion from quasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes. Using an empirical law for AGN obscuration, our model matches the observed luminosity functions (LFs) of AGNs over a wide range of redshifts. Due to the suppression of cooling in massive haloes by AGN feedback, at low redshift (z≲ 2), the brightest quasars (Lbol≳ 1046 erg s-1) are predicted preferentially to inhabit haloes with masses ?. The model predicts a hierarchical buildup of BH mass, with the typical mass of actively growing BHs increasing with decreasing redshift. Nevertheless, the model displays clear 'downsizing' as reflected in the differential evolution of the space density of faint and bright AGNs. This arises naturally from the interplay between the starburst and hot gas halo accretion modes. The faint end of the LF is dominated by massive BHs accreting at low rates via a thick disc, primarily during the hot-halo mode. The bright end is populated by BHs accreting close to or above the Eddington limit during the starburst mode. Obscuration plays a central role in determining the observed abundance of AGNs and, hence, in their implied cosmic evolution.},

A possible evolutionary scenario explaining the relationship between various types of AGN is proposed, in which, in addition to differences in the accretion states of the circumnuclear disks, the type of host galaxy is also taken into consideration. Special attention is given to the qualitative similarity of the accretion and radiative processes occurring in active objects with stellar-mass black holes (microquasars) and in AGN, in spite of the huge differences in the masses of their black holes. Studies of variability of the emission of microquasars taking this similarity into account can be used to make predictions about the behavior of the emission of AGN (with scaling in accordance with the black-hole mass).},

Up to now, the AGN luminosity function has been estimated several times in soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard X-rays (2-10 keV). AGN selection in these energy ranges often suffers from identification and redshift incompleteness and, at the same time, photoelectric absorption can obscure a significant amount of the X-ray radiation. We estimate the evolution of the luminosity function in the 5-10 keV band, where we effectively avoid the absorbed part of the spectrum, rendering absorption corrections unnecessary up to N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}23{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.

For sources lacking a spectroscopic redshift estimation we use the probability distribution function of photometric redshift estimation specifically tuned for AGN, and a flat probability distribution function for sources with no redshift information. We use Bayesian analysis to select the best parametric model from simple pure luminosity and pure density evolution to more complicated luminosity and density evolution and luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE). We estimate the model parameters that describe best our dataset separately for each survey and for the combined sample. We show that, according to Bayesian model selection, the preferred model for our dataset is the LDDE. Our estimation of the AGN luminosity function does not require any assumption on the AGN absorption and is in good agreement with previous works in the 2-10 keV energy band based on X-ray hardness ratios to model the absorption in AGN up to redshift three. Our sample does not show evidence of a rapid decline of the AGN luminosity function up to redshift four.},

The templates are themselves IRS spectra from extreme cases where a single physical component (stellar, interstellar, or AGN) completely dominates the integrated mid-infrared emission. We show that a linear combination of one template for each physical component reproduces the observed IRS spectra of AGN hosts with unprecedented fidelity for a template fitting method with no need to model extinction separately. We use full probability distribution functions to estimate expectation values and uncertainties for observables, and find that the decomposition results are robust against degeneracies. Furthermore, we compare the AGN spectra derived from the spectral decomposition with sub-arcsecond resolution nuclear photometry and spectroscopy from ground-based observations. We find that the AGN component derived from the decomposition closely matches the nuclear spectrum with a 1σ dispersion of 0.12 dex in luminosity and typical uncertainties of ∼0.19 in the spectral index and ∼0.1 in the silicate strength. We conclude that the emission from the host galaxy can be reliably removed from the IRS spectra of AGNs. This allows for unbiased studies of the AGN emission in intermediate- and high-redshift galaxies—currently inaccesible to ground-based observations—with archival Spitzer/IRS data and in the future with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope.

The AGN span over three orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity (10{\textasciicircum}\{42\} {\textless} L\_\{2-8 keV\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{45.5\} erg s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}) and are in the redshift range z = 0.2-2.5. Using infrared (IR) photometry (8-500 μ m), including deblended Spitzer and Herschel images and taking into account photometric upper limits, we decompose the IR spectral energy distributions into AGN and star formation components. Using the IR luminosities due to star formation, we investigate the average SFRs as a function of redshift and AGN luminosity. In agreement with previous studies, we find a strong evolution of the average SFR with redshift, tracking the observed evolution of the overall star-forming galaxy population. However, we find that the relationship between the average SFR and AGN luminosity is broadly flat at all redshifts and across all the AGN luminosities investigated; in comparison to previous studies, we find less scatter amongst the average SFRs across the wide range of AGN luminosities investigated. By comparing to empirical models, we argue that the observed flat relationship is due to short time-scale variations in AGN luminosity, driven by changes in the mass accretion rate, which wash out any underlying correlations between SFR and L\_AGN. Furthermore, we show that the exact form of the predicted relationship between SFR and AGN luminosity (and its normalization) is highly sensitive to the assumed intrinsic Eddington ratio distribution.},

We estimate an average dust covering factor (CF) of 33\% based on IR SEDs and bolometric AGN luminosity, corresponding to a Type 2 AGN population of roughly a third. We also see a population of AGN that challenge the inclination-based unification model with individual dust CFs that contradict the nuclear obscuration expected from observed X-ray hardness ratios. We see no strong connection between AGN fractions in the IR and corresponding total IR, 24 μm, or X-ray luminosities. The average rest-frame AGN contribution as a function of IR wavelength shows significant (∼80\%) contributions in the mid-IR that trail off at λ {\textgreater} 30 μm.

Stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis of observed galaxy colors. Dust emission (mostly PAH) accounts for 80\% of the 8 μm luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19\%, and AGN emission accounts for roughly 1\%. A subsample of the 8 μm-selected galaxies have blue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant PAH emission. The luminosity functions for the total 8 μm luminosity and for the dust emission alone are both well fit by Schechter functions. For the 8 μm luminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is νL*ν(8.0 μm)=1.8×1010 Lsolar, while for the dust emission alone it is 1.6×1010 Lsolar. The average 8 μm luminosity density at z{\textless}0.3 is 3.1×107 Lsolar Mpc-3, and the average luminosity density from dust alone is 2.5×107 Lsolar Mpc-3.

	abstract = {Empirical "backward" galaxy evolution models for infrared (IR) bright galaxies are constrained using multiband IR surveys. We developed a new Monte Carlo algorithm for this task, implementing luminosity-dependent distribution functions for the galaxies' IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contribution, allowing for evolution of these quantities. The adopted SEDs take into account the contributions of both starbursts and AGN to the IR emission, for the first time in a coherent treatment rather than invoking separate AGN and star-forming populations. In the first part of the paper we consider the quantification of the AGN contribution for local universe galaxies, as a function of the total IR luminosity. It is made using a large sample of luminous infrared galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies for which mid-IR spectra are available in the Spitzer archive. We find the ratio of AGN 6 μm luminosity and the total IR luminosity to rise with L 1.4 TIR over the IR luminosity range 1011-1013 L sun and estimate its spread. Judging from the modest number of distant sources with Spitzer spectroscopy, the relation changes at high-z. In the second part we present the model. Our best-fit model adopts very strong luminosity evolution, L = L 0(1 + z)3.4, up to z = 2.3, and density evolution, ρ = ρ0(1 + z)2, up to z = 1, for the population of IR galaxies. At higher z, the evolution rates drop as (1 + z)-1 and (1 + z)-1.5, respectively. To reproduce mid-IR to submillimeter number counts and redshift distributions, it is necessary to introduce both an evolution in the AGN contribution and an evolution in the luminosity-temperature relation. At a given total IR luminosity, high-redshift IR galaxies have typically smaller AGN contributions to the rest-frame mid-IR, and colder far-IR dust temperatures than locally. We also suggest an extension of the local IR galaxy population toward lower dust temperatures. Our models are in plausible agreement with current photometry-based estimates of the typical AGN contribution as a function of mid-IR flux, and well placed to be compared to upcoming Spitzer spectroscopic results. As an example of future applications, we use our best-fitting model to make predictions for surveys with Herschel.},

The 5-35 μm Infrared Spectrograph spectra allow us to estimate accurately the luminosities and build the LFs. Using a combination of starburst and quasar templates, we quantify the star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) contributions in the mid-IR spectral energy distribution. We then compute the SF LFs at 15 and 24 μm, and compare with the total 15 and 24 μm LFs. When we remove the contribution of AGNs, the bright end of the LF exhibits a strong decline, consistent with the exponential cutoff of a Schechter function. Integrating the differential LF, we find that the fractional contribution by SF to the energy density is 58\% at 15 μm and 78\% at 24 μm, while it goes up to {\textasciitilde}86\% when we extrapolate our mid-IR results to the total IR luminosity density. We confirm that the AGNs play more important roles energetically at high luminosities. Finally, we compare our results with work at z {\textasciitilde} 0.7 and confirm that evolution on both luminosity and density is required to explain the difference in the LFs at different redshifts.},

Using the Spitzer-IRAC data over an area of 1.8 deg2 covered by the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, we estimate the contribution from hot-dust at rest-frame 4.2 μm (from 0 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.2 up to 0.5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.9). This wavelength corresponds to blackbody temperature of {\textasciitilde}690 K. The contribution of stellar emission is estimated from the rest-frame 1.6 μm luminosity (assumed to result from stellar emission alone) and subtracted from the mid-infrared luminosity of galaxies to measure hot-dust emission. To attempt the study of the 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature, we use the rest-frame 4.2 μm to infer the hot-dust flux at 3.3 μm. This study is performed for different spectral types of galaxies: early-type, late-type, starburst, and IR-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that (1) the decrease of the hot-dust luminosity density since 0.5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1 is steeper (by at least 0.5 dex) compared with that of the cold-dust, giving support to the scenario where galaxy obscuration increases with redshift, as proposed in the literature; (2) hot-dust and PAH emission evolution seems to be correlated with stellar mass, where rest-frame 1.6 μm luminous non-AGN galaxies (i.e., massive systems) show a stronger decrement (with decreasing redshift) in hot-dust and PAH emission than the less luminous (less massive) non-AGN galaxies; (3) despite comprising {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 3\% of the total sample, AGN contribute as much as a third to the hot-dust luminosity density at z {\textless} 1 and clearly dominate the bright-end of the total hot-dust luminosity density function at 0.5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.9; (4) the average dust-to-total luminosity ratio increases with redshift, while PAH-to-total luminosity ratio remains fairly constant; (5) at M 1.6 {\textgreater} -25, the dust-to-total and PAH-to-total luminosity ratios increase with decreasing luminosity, but deeper data are required to confirm this result.

The form and evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at high redshifts provide crucial information on star formation history and mass assembly in the young Universe, close or even prior to the epoch of reionization. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We used the unique combination of deep optical/near-infrared/mid-infrared imaging provided by HST, Spitzer, and the VLT in the CANDELS-UDS, GOODS-South, and HUDF fields to determine the GSMF over the redshift range 3.5 ≤ z ≤ 7.5. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the HST WFC3/IR near-infrared imaging from CANDELS and HUDF09, reaching H ≃ 27 - 28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, in combination with associated deep HST ACS optical data, deep Spitzer IRAC imaging from the SEDS programme, and deep Y and K-band VLT Hawk-I images from the HUGS programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometric redshifts. These have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.5 ≤ z ≤ 7.5, resulting in an overall precision of σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}z{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ (1 + z) {\textasciitilde} 0.037. With this database we have determined the low-mass end of the high-redshift GSMF with unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as M{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at z = 4 and {\textasciitilde}6 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at z = 7. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find that the GSMF at 3.5 ≤ z ≤ 7.5 depends only slightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely the photometric redshifts, the star formation histories, the nebular contribution, or the presence of AGN in the parent sample. The low-mass end of the GSMF is steeper than has been found at lower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probed here. Meanwhile the high-mass end of the GSMF appears to evolve primarily in density, although there is also some evidence of evolution in characteristic mass. Our results are very different from previous mass function estimates based on converting UV galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight mass-to-light relations. Integrating our evolving GSMF over mass, we find that the growth of stellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the star formation rate density over cosmic time at z\&gt; 4. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: These results confirm the unique synergy of the CANDELS+HUDF, HUGS, and SEDS surveys for the discovery and study of moderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts, and reaffirm the importance of space-based infrared selection for the unbiased measurement of the evolving GSMF in the young Universe. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424750/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We present a study of nearby galaxies as a function of their [3.4]-[4.6] colour. Galaxies that are red in their [3.4]-[4.6] colour contain heated dust and the reddest systems ([3.4]-[4.6] {\textgreater} 0.5) are classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) by some selection criteria. The sample discussed here includes nearby galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that are also in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue. We calculate the number density of galaxies, in the form of the luminosity and mass functions, using the V/Vmax method and a stepwise maximum likelihood method that has been modified to account for the additional colour selection. The reddest galaxies which have [3.4]-[4.6] {\textgreater} 0.8 and are sometimes classified as AGN by their colour make up 0.2 per cent of nearby galaxies. However, the reddest galaxies are a rising fraction of the low-mass galaxy population. Identifying the lowest mass (M {\textless} 108 M⊙) red ([3.4]-[4.6] {\textgreater} 0.8) galaxies as AGN is surprising given that none are optical AGN or composites, in contrast with their more massive (M {\textgreater} 1010 M⊙) red galaxy counterparts that are dominated by optical AGN and composites (86.4 per cent). We also show that these low-mass red galaxies are associated with higher specific star formation rates than their bluer counterparts. While the properties of this relatively rare segment of nearby low-mass galaxies are intriguing, particularly if they are associated with AGN activity, there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether it is AGN or unusual star formation that is driving red colours in these systems.},

	abstract = {We show that binned differential luminosity functions constructed using the 1/Va method have a significant systematic error for objects close to the flux limit(s) of their parent sample. This is particularly noticeable when luminosity functions are produced for a number of different redshift ranges as is common in the study of AGN or galaxy evolution. We present a simple method of constructing a binned luminosity function which overcomes this problem and has a number of other advantages over the traditional 1/Va method. We also describe a practical method for comparing binned and model luminosity functions, by calculating the expectation values of the binned luminosity function from the model. Binned luminosity functions produced by the two methods are compared for simulated data and for the Large Bright QSO Survey (LBQS). It is shown that the 1/Va method produces a very misleading picture of evolution in the LBQS. The binned luminosity function of the LBQS is then compared with a model two-power-law luminosity function undergoing pure luminosity evolution from Boyle et al. The comparison is made using a model luminosity function averaged over each redshift shell, and using the expectation values for the binned luminosity function calculated from the model. The luminosity function averaged in each redshift shell gives a misleading impression that the model over predicts the number of QSOs at low luminosity even for 1.0{\textless} z{\textless}1.5, when model and data are consistent. The expectation values show that there are significant differences between model and data: the model overpredicts the number of low luminosity sources at both low and high redshift. The luminosity function does not appear to steepen relative to the model as redshift increases.},

This yields a set of optical spectra of 912 candidate NVSS counterparts, of which we identify 757 as genuine radio identifications - the largest and most homogeneous set of radio source spectra ever obtained. The 2dFGRS radio sources span the redshift range z=0.005 to 0.438, and are a mixture of active galaxies (60 per cent) and star-forming galaxies (40 per cent). About 25 per cent of the 2dFGRS radio sources are spatially resolved by NVSS, and the sample includes three giant radio galaxies with projected linear size greater than 1Mpc. The high quality of the 2dF spectra means we can usually distinguish unambiguously between AGN and star-forming galaxies. We make a new determination of the local radio luminosity function at 1.4GHz for both active and star-forming galaxies, and derive a local star formation density of 0.022+/-0.004Msolaryr-1Mpc-3 (H0=50kms-1Mpc-1).},

Because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in a spectroscopic survey, the luminosity density could still be significantly underestimated. We also find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies compared to the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the VVDS compared to former estimates. Therefore, the VVDS paints a quite different picture of the role of the most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile, program 070.A-9007(A). {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

The break luminosity is close to the dividing line between the two Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes for the large-scale radio structure of these objects. We use an analytical model for the luminosity and size evolution of FR type II (FRII) objects together with a simple prescription for FR type I (FRI) sources to construct the RLF. We postulate that all sources start out with a FRII morphology. Weaker jets subsequently disrupt within the quasi-constant density cores of their host galaxies and develop the turbulent lobes of FRI. With this model, we recover the slopes of the power laws and the break luminosity of the RLF determined from observations. The rate at which active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets of jet power Q appear in the universe is found to be proportional to Q-1.6. The model also roughly predicts the distribution of the radio lobe sizes for FRII objects, if the radio luminosity of the turbulent jets drops significantly at the point of disruption. We show that our model is consistent with recent ideas of two distinct accretion modes in jet-producing AGN if radiative efficiency of the accretion process is correlated with jet power.},

This effect is more pronounced for samples with steep and strongly evolving parent LFs but is still present even for non-evolving LFs. As a result of this distortion of the true LF, fitting a model LF to binned data may lead to errors in the estimation of the parameters and may even prompt the erroneous use of broken power-law functions. We compute the expected positions of apparent breaks in the binned LF. We show that these spurious breaks in the binned LFs can be avoided if the binning is done in the flux-redshift plane instead of the typically used luminosity-redshift plane. Binning in the flux-redshift plane can be used in conjunction with the binning in the luminosity-redshift plane to test for real breaks in the binned LFs and to identify the features that are the result of binning biases. We illustrate this effect for most typical forms of luminosity dependence and redshift evolution and show how the proposed method helps address this problem. We also apply this method to the MOJAVE AGN sample and show that it eliminates an apparent break in the binned LF.},

A density evolution {\textasciitilde} (1 + z)3.4+/-0.9 or a luminosity evolution {\textasciitilde} exp(1.7tL/τ), where tL is the look-back time, is detected in the full sample in the redshift range [0.02, 0.1], consistent with previous analyses. Of the four infrared subpopulations, cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts show similar evolutionary trends, galaxies with significant active galactic nucleus contributions show stronger positive evolution and Arp 220-type starbursts exhibit strong negative evolution. The dominant subpopulation changes from cirrus-type galaxies to M82-type starbursts at log10(L60/Lsolar) {\textasciitilde} 10.3. In the second half of the paper, we derive the projected two-point spatial correlation function for galaxies of different infrared template types. The mean relative bias between cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts, which correspond to quiescent galaxies with optically thin interstellar dust and actively star-forming galaxies, respectively, is calculated to be bcirrus/bM82 = 1.25 +/- 0.07. The relation between the current star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming galaxies and environment is investigated by looking at the dependence of clustering on infrared luminosity. We found that M82-type actively star-forming galaxies show stronger clustering as infrared luminosity/SFR increases. The correlation between the clustering strength and SFR in the local Universe seems to echo the basic trend seen in star-forming galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey fields (at z {\textasciitilde} 1).},

We utilize data from a number of surveys including both the 2Ms Chandra Deep Fields and the AEGIS-X 200ks survey, enabling accurate measurements of the evolution of the faint end of the XLF. We combine direct, hard X-ray selection and spectroscopic follow-up or photometric redshift estimates at z {\textless} 1.2 with a rest-frame UV colour pre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated with catastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. Only robust optical counterparts to X-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matching technique. A Bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshift probability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our high-redshift samples and allows robust comparison of different evolutionary models. We statistically account for X-ray sources without optical counterparts to correct for incompleteness in our samples. We also account for Poissonian effects on the X-ray flux estimates and sensitivities and thus correct for the Eddington bias. We find that the XLF retains the same shape at all redshifts, but undergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z {\textasciitilde} 1, and an overall negative density evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolution at earlier times. We do not find evidence that a luminosity-dependent density evolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required to describe the evolution of the XLF. We find significantly higher space densities of low-luminosity, high-redshift AGN than in prior studies, and a smaller shift in the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasing luminosity. The total luminosity density of AGN peaks at z = 1.2 +/- 0.1, but there is a mild decline to higher redshifts.

A total of more than 1600 AGNs with 2-10 keV de-absorbed luminosities higher than 1042 erg s-1 cm-2 were used. For a sub-sample of about fifty z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 AGNs, it was possible to reach {\textasciitilde}80\% of radio detections and therefore, for the first time, it was possible to almost completely measure the probability distribution function of the ratio between the radio and the X-ray luminosity RX = log(L 1.4/LX ), where L 1.4/LX = νL ν(1.4 GHz)/LX (2-10 keV). The probability distribution function of RX was functionally fitted as dependent on the X-ray luminosity and redshift, P(RX {\textbar}LX , z). It roughly spans over six decades (-7{\textless} RX {\textless}-1) and does not show any sign of bi-modality. The result is that the probability of finding large values of the RX ratio increases with decreasing X-ray luminosities and (possibly) with increasing redshift. No statistically significant difference was found between the radio properties of the X-ray absorbed (N H{\textgreater}1022 cm-2) and un-absorbed AGNs. Measurement of the probability distribution function of RX allowed us to compute the kinetic luminosity function and the kinetic energy density which, at variance with that assumed in many galaxy evolution models, is observed to decrease by about a factor of 5 at redshift below 0.5. About half of the kinetic energy density results in being produced by the more radio quiet (RX {\textless}-4) AGNs. In agreement with previous estimates, the AGN efficiency epsilonkin in converting the accreted mass energy into kinetic power (L\_K=ɛ\_kin{\textbackslash}dot\{m\} c{\textasciicircum}2) is, on average, epsilonkin {\textasciitilde}= 5 × 10-3.

	abstract = {Context. The study of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) in different environments provides powerful constraints on the physics of galaxy evolution. The infrared (IR) LF is a particularly useful tool since it is directly related to the distribution of galaxy star-formation rates (SFRs). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to determine the galaxy IR LF as a function of the environment in a supercluster at redshift 0.23 to shed light on the processes driving galaxy evolution in and around clusters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We base our analysis on multi-wavelength data, which include optical, near-IR, and mid- to far-IR photometry, as well as redshifts from optical spectroscopy. We identify 467 supercluster members in a sample of 24-μm-selected galaxies, on the basis of their spectroscopic (153) and photometric (314) redshifts. IR luminosities and stellar masses are determined for supercluster members via spectral energy distribution fitting. Galaxies with active galactic nuclei are identified by a variety of methods and excluded from the sample. SFRs are obtained for the 432 remaining galaxies from their IR luminosities via the Kennicutt relation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We determine the IR LF of the whole supercluster as well as the IR LFs of three different regions in the supercluster: the cluster core, a large-scale filament, and the cluster outskirts (excluding the filament). A comparison of the IR LFs of the three regions, normalized by the average number densities of r-band selected normal galaxies, shows that the filament (respectively, the core) contains the highest (respectively, the lowest) fraction of IR-emitting galaxies at all levels of IR luminosities, and the highest (respectively, the lowest) total SFR normalized by optical galaxy richness. Luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs) are almost absent in the core region. The relation between galaxy specific SFRs and stellar masses does not depend on the environment, and it indicates that most supercluster LIRGs are rather massive galaxies with relatively low specific SFRs. A comparison with previous IR LF determinations from the literature confirms that the mass-normalized total SFR in clusters increases with redshift, but more rapidly than previously suggested for redshifts ≲ 0.4. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The IR LF shows an environmental dependence that is not simply related to the local galaxy density. The filament, an intermediate-density region in the A1763 supercluster, contains the highest fraction of IR-emitting galaxies. We interpret our findings within a possible scenario for the evolution of galaxies in and around clusters.},

	abstract = {Semi-analytic models (SAMs) are currently one of the primary tools with which we model statistically significant ensembles of galaxies. The underlying physical prescriptions inherent to each SAM are, in many cases, different from one another. Several SAMs have been applied to the dark matter merger trees extracted from the Millennium Run, including those associated with the well-known Munich and Durham lineages. We compare the predicted luminosity distributions of galaxy groups using four publicly available SAMs, in order to explore a galactic environment in which the models have not been explored to the same degree as they have in the field or in rich clusters. We identify a characteristic 'wiggle' in the group galaxy luminosity function generated using the De Lucia et al. SAM, which is not present in the Durham-based models, consistent to some degree with observations. However, a comparison between conditional luminosity functions of groups between the models and observations suggests that neither model is a particularly good match. The luminosity function wiggle is interpreted as the result of the two-mode active galactic nucleus feedback implementation used in the Munich models, which itself results in flattened magnitude gap distribution. An associated analysis of the magnitude gap distribution between first- and second-ranked group galaxies shows that while the Durham models yield distributions with approximately equal luminosity first- and second-ranked galaxies, in agreement with observations, the De Lucia et al. models favour the scenario in which the second-ranked galaxy is approximately 1 mag fainter than the primary, especially when the dynamic range of the mock data is limited to 3 mag.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new grid-based method for investigating the evolution of the steep-spectrum radio luminosity function, with the aim of quantifying the high-redshift cut-off suggested by previous work. To achieve this, the Combined EIS-NVSS Survey of Radio Sources (CENSORS) has been developed; this is a 1.4-GHz radio survey, containing 135 sources complete to a flux density of 7.2 mJy, selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) over 6 deg2 of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) Patch D. The sample is currently 73 per cent spectroscopically complete, with the remaining redshifts estimated via the K-z or I-z magnitude-redshift relation. CENSORS is combined with additional radio data from the Parkes All-Sky, Parkes Selected Regions, Hercules and Very Large Array (VLA) COSMOS samples to provide comprehensive coverage of the radio power versus redshift plane. The redshift distributions of these samples, together with radio source count determinations, and measurements of the local luminosity function, provide the input to the fitting process. The modelling reveals clear declines, at {\textgreater}3σ significance, in comoving density at z {\textgreater} 0.7 for lower luminosity sources (log P = 25-26); these turnovers are still present at log P {\textgreater} 27, but move to z ≳ 3, suggesting a luminosity-dependent evolution of the redshift turnover, similar to the 'cosmic downsizing' seen for other active galactic nucleus populations. These results are shown to be robust to the estimated redshift errors and to increases in the spectral index for the highest redshift sources. Analytic fits to the best-fitting steep spectrum grid are provided so that the results presented here can be easily accessed by the reader, as well as allowing plausible extrapolations outside of the regions covered by the input data sets.},

Our sample consists of 39 996 NUV {\textless} 22.8 emission line galaxies in the redshift range 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9. This sample selects galaxies with high star formation rates: at 0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9 the median star formation rate is at the upper 95th percentile of optically selected (r {\textless} 22.5) galaxies and the sample contains about 50 per cent of all NUV {\textless} 22.8, 0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9 starburst galaxies within the volume sampled. The most luminous galaxies in our sample ( - 21.0 {\textgreater} MNUV {\textgreater} -22.5) evolve very rapidly with a number density declining as (1 + z)5±1 from redshift z = 0.9 to 0.6. These starburst galaxies (MNUV {\textless} -21 is approximately a star formation rate of 30 M⊙ yr-1) contribute about 1 per cent of cosmic star formation over the redshift range z = 0.6-0.9. The star formation rate density of these very luminous galaxies evolves rapidly, as (1 + z)4±1. Such a rapid evolution implies that the majority of star formation in these large galaxies must have occurred before z = 0.9. We measure the UV luminosity function in Δz = 0.05 redshift intervals spanning 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9, and provide analytic fits to the results. Our measurements of the luminosity function over this redshift range probe further into the bright end (1-2 mag further) than previous measurements, e.g. Arnouts et al., Budavári et al. and Treyer et al., due to our much larger sample size and sampled volume. At all redshifts z {\textgreater} 0.55 we find that the bright end of the luminosity function is not well described by a pure Schechter function due to an excess of very luminous (MNUV {\textless} -22) galaxies. These luminosity functions can be used to create a radial selection function for the WiggleZ survey or test models of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we test the AGN feedback model in Scannapieco, Silk \& Bouwens, and find that this AGN feedback model requires AGN feedback efficiency to vary with one or more of the following: stellar mass, star formation rate and redshift.},

The clusters were identified as Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) color-selected overdensities in the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN project, which imaged 420 powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) at z {\textgreater} 1.3. The luminosity functions are derived for different redshift and richness bins, and the IRAC imaging reaches depths of m* + 2, allowing us to measure the faint end slopes of the luminosity functions. We find that α = -1 describes the luminosity function very well in all redshift bins and does not evolve significantly. This provides evidence that the rate at which the low mass galaxy population grows through star formation gets quenched and is replenished by in-falling field galaxies does not have a major net effect on the shape of the luminosity function. Our measurements for m* are consistent with passive evolution models and high formation redshifts (zf {\textasciitilde} 3). We find a slight trend toward fainter m* for the richest clusters, implying that the most massive clusters in our sample could contain older stellar populations, yet another example of cosmic downsizing. Modeling shows that a contribution of a star-forming population of up to 40\% cannot be ruled out. This value, found from our targeted survey, is significantly lower than the values found for slightly lower redshift, z {\textasciitilde} 1, clusters found in wide-field surveys. The results are consistent with cosmic downsizing, as the clusters studied here were all found in the vicinity of RLAGNs—which have proven to be preferentially located in massive dark matter halos in the richest environments at high redshift—and they may therefore be older and more evolved systems than the general protocluster population.},

The depth and size of GAMA allows us to define samples split by colour and redshift to measure the dependence of the LF on environment, redshift and colour. We find that the LF varies smoothly with overdensity, consistent with previous results, with little environmental dependent evolution over the last 3 Gyr. The modified GALFORM model predictions agree remarkably well with our LFs split by environment, particularly in the most overdense environments. The LFs predicted by the model for both blue and red galaxies are consistent with GAMA for the environments and luminosities at which such galaxies dominate. Discrepancies between the model and the data seen in the faint end of the LF suggest too many faint red galaxies are predicted, which is likely to be due to the over-quenching of satellite galaxies. The excess of bright blue galaxies predicted in underdense regions could be due to the implementation of AGN feedback not being sufficiently effective in the lower mass haloes.},

We find that the traditional bivariate RLF estimators can cause bias in varying degrees.

We believe that the bias is caused because the K-corrections complicate the truncation boundary on the L-z plane of the sample, but the traditional bivariate RLF estimators have difficulty dealing with this boundary condition properly. We suggest that the spectral index distribution should be incorporated into the RLF analysis process to obtain a robust estimation. This drives the need for a trivariate function of the form Φ(α, z, L), which we show provides an accurate basis for measuring the RLF.},

This mixture evolution scenario can naturally explain the luminosity-dependent evolution of radio-loud AGNs. Our models successfully fitted a large amount of data on radio luminosity functions of steep-spectrum sources and multi-frequency source counts. The modeling indicates that the DE slowly increases as \{(1+z)\}0.3∼ 1.3 out to z∼ 0.8, and then rapidly decreases as \{(1+z)\}-6.8∼ -5.7, while the LE rapidly increases as \{(1+z)\}4.8 out to a higher redshift (at least z{\textgreater} 3.5). We find a high-redshift decline (i.e., redshift cutoff) in the number density of steep-spectrum radio sources, but we cannot conclude whether such a decline is sharp or shallow. We believe that whether a redshift cutoff occurs or not depends mainly on DE, while its steepness is decided by LE, which, however, cannot be well constrained due to the lack of high-redshift samples. Most intriguingly, according to our mixture evolution scenario, there appears to be no need for different evolution for the low- and high-power radio-loud AGNs. Both types of sources experience the same combined evolution of DE and LE.},

	abstract = {The lack of a strong correlation between AGN X-ray luminosity (LX; a proxy for AGN power) and the star formation rate (SFR) of their host galaxies has recently been attributed to stochastic AGN variability. Studies using population synthesis models have incorporated this by assuming a broad, universal (i.e. does not depend on the host galaxy properties) probability distribution for AGN specific X-ray luminosities (i.e. the ratio of LX to host stellar mass; a common proxy for Eddington ratio). However, recent studies have demonstrated that this universal Eddington ratio distribution fails to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions beyond z ∼ 1.2. Furthermore, empirical studies have recently shown that the Eddington ratio distribution may instead depend upon host galaxy properties, such as SFR and/or stellar mass. To investigate this further, we develop a population synthesis model in which the Eddington ratio distribution is different for star-forming and quiescent host galaxies. We show that, although this model is able to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions out to z ∼ 2, it fails to simultaneously reproduce the observed flat relationship between SFR and X-ray luminosity. We can solve this, however, by incorporating a mass dependency in the AGN Eddington ratio distribution for star-forming host galaxies. Overall, our models indicate that a relative suppression of low Eddington ratios (λEdd ≲ 0.1) in lower mass galaxies (M* ≲ 1010 - 11 M⊙) is required to reproduce both the observed X-ray luminosity functions and the observed flat SFR/X-ray relationship.},

These 3740 z ∼ 4 galaxies are selected from broadband imaging in nine photometric bands over 18 deg2 in the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large Area Survey field. The large area and moderate depth of our survey provide a unique view of the intersection between the bright end of the galaxy UV luminosity function (M AB {\textless} -22) and the faint end of the AGN UV luminosity function. We do not separate AGN-dominated galaxies from star-formation-dominated galaxies, but rather fit both luminosity functions simultaneously. These functions are best fit with a double power law for both the galaxy and AGN components, where the galaxy bright-end slope has a power-law index of -3.80 ± 0.10 and the corresponding AGN faint-end slope is \{α \vphantom{\{}\}AGN\}=-\{1.49\}-0.21+0.30. We cannot rule out a Schechter-like exponential decline for the galaxy UV luminosity function, and in this scenario the AGN luminosity function has a steeper faint-end slope of -\{2.08\}-0.11+0.18. Comparison of our galaxy luminosity function results with a representative cosmological model of galaxy formation suggests that the molecular gas depletion time must be shorter, implying that star formation is more efficient in bright galaxies at z = 4 than at the present day. If the galaxy luminosity function does indeed have a power-law shape at the bright end, the implied ionizing emissivity from AGNs is not inconsistent with previous observations. However, if the underlying galaxy distribution is Schechter, it implies a significantly higher ionizing emissivity from AGNs at this epoch.},

	abstract = {The radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are traditionally measured based on total emission, which does not reflect the current activity of the central black hole. The increasing interest in compact radio cores of AGNs motivates determination of the RLF based on core emission (i.e., core RLF). In this work we have established a large sample (totaling 1207) of radio-loud AGNs, mainly consisting of radio galaxies (RGs) and steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs). Based on the sample, we explore the relationship between core luminosity (L c ) and total luminosity (L t ) via a powerful statistical tool called “Copula.” The conditional probability distribution p(\{log\}\{L\}c{\textbar} \{log\}\{L\}t) is obtained. We derive the core RLF as a convolution of p(\{log\}\{L\}c{\textbar} \{log\}\{L\}t) with the total RLF that was determined by previous work. We relate the separate RG and SSRQ core RLFs via a relativistic beaming model and find that SSRQs have an average Lorentz factor of γ =\{9.84\}-2.50+3.61, and that most are seen within 8° ≲ θ ≲ 45° of the jet axis. Compared with the total RLF, which is mainly contributed by extended emission, the core RLF shows a very weak luminosity-dependent evolution, with the number density peaking around z ∼ 0.8 for all luminosities. Differences between core and total RLFs can be explained in a framework involving a combination of density and luminosity evolutions where the cores have significantly weaker luminosity evolution than the extended emission.},

	abstract = {We present the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, measured above and below the 5σ detection threshold, using a Bayesian model-fitting technique. The radio flux densities from Very Large Array (VLA)-COSMOS 3-GHz data are extracted at the position of stellar-mass-selected galaxies. We fit a local RLF model, which is a combination of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies (SFGs), in 10 redshift bins with a pure luminosity evolution model. Our RLF exceeds previous determinations at low radio luminosities at z {\textless} 1.6 with the same radio data, due to our ability to directly constrain the knee and faint-end slope of the RLF. Beyond z {\textasciitilde} 2, we find that the SFG part of the RLF exhibits a negative evolution (L* moves to lower luminosities) due to the decrease in low stellar-mass galaxies in our sample at high redshifts. From the RLF for SFGs, we determine the evolution in the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), which we find to be consistent with the established behaviour up to z {\textasciitilde} 1 using far-infrared data, but exceeds that from the previous radio-based work for the reasons highlighted above. Beyond z {\textasciitilde} 1.5 the cosmic SFRD declines. We note that the relation between radio luminosity and star formation rate is crucial in measuring the cosmic SFRD from radio data at z {\textgreater} 1.5. We investigate the effects of stellar mass on the total RLF by splitting our sample into low (108.5 ≤ M/M⊙ ≤ 1010) and high (\$M 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) stellar-mass subsets. We find that the SFRD is dominated by sources in the high stellar masses bin, at all redshifts.},

We find the evolution of AGN with redshift to be consistent with pure luminosity evolution (PLE) models in which the evolution slows markedly or stops at high redshifts (z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1.8). We find that this result is not affected by the inclusion, or exclusion, of narrow-emission-line galaxies at low redshift in the RIXOS and EMSS samples, and is insensitive to uncertainties in the conversion between flux values measured with ROSAT and Einstein.

	abstract = {The cosmological star formation rate in the combined Chandra Deep Fields North and South is derived from our X-ray luminosity function for galaxies in these deep fields. Mild evolution is seen up to redshift order unity with star formation rate{\textasciitilde}(1+z)2.7. This is the first directly observed normal star-forming galaxy X-ray luminosity function (XLF) at cosmologically interesting redshifts (z{\textgreater}0). This provides the most direct measure yet of the X-ray-derived cosmic star formation history of the universe. We make use of Bayesian statistical methods to classify the galaxies and the two types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), finding the most useful discriminators to be the X-ray luminosity, X-ray hardness ratio, and X-ray to optical flux ratio. There is some residual AGN contamination in the sample at the bright end of the luminosity function. Incompleteness slightly flattens the XLF at the faint end of the luminosity function. The XLF has a lognormal distribution and agrees well with the radio and infrared luminosity functions. However, the XLF does not agree with the Schechter luminosity function for the Hα LF, indicating that, as discussed in the text, additional and different physical processes may be involved in the establishment of the lognormal form of the XLF. The agreement of our star formation history points with the other star formation determinations in different wavebands (IR, radio, Hα) gives an interesting constraint on the initial mass function (IMF). The X-ray emission in the Chandra band is most likely due to binary stars, although X-ray emission from nonstellar sources (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes and/or low-luminosity AGNs) remains a possibility. Under the assumption that it is due to binary stars, the overall consistency and correlations between single-star effects and binary-star effects indicate that not only is the one-parameter IMF (M) constant but also the bivariate IMF(M1, M2) must be constant, at least at the high-mass end. Another way to put this, quite simply, is that X-ray observations may be measuring directly the binary-star formation history of the universe. X-ray studies will continue to be useful for probing the star formation history of the universe by avoiding problems of obscuration. Star formation may therefore be measured in more detail by deep surveys with future X-ray missions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we estimate the local (z {\textless} 0.22) X-ray luminosity function of `normal' galaxies derived from the XMM-Newton Needles in the Haystack Survey. This is an on-going project that aims to identify X-ray-selected normal galaxies (i.e. non-AGN dominated) in the local Universe. We are using a total of 70 XMM-Newton fields covering an area of 11 deg2 which overlap with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2. Normal galaxies are selected on the basis of their resolved optical light profile, their low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio [log(fx/fo) {\textless} - 2] and soft X-ray colours. We find a total of 28 candidate normal galaxies to the 0.5-8keV band flux limit of {\textasciitilde}2 × 10-15ergcm-2s-1. Optical spectra are available for most sources in our sample (82 per cent). These provide additional evidence that our sources are bona fide normal galaxies with X-ray emission coming from diffuse hot gas emission and/or X-ray binaries rather than a supermassive black hole. 16 of our galaxies have narrow emission lines or a late-type spectral energy distribution (SED) while the remaining 12 present only absorption lines or an early-type SED. Combining our XMM-Newton sample with 18 local (z {\textless} 0.22) galaxies from the Chandra Deep Field North and South surveys, we construct the local X-ray luminosity function of normal galaxies. This can be represented with a Schechter form with a break at L*{\textasciitilde} 3+1.4-1.0× 1041ergs-1 and a slope of α{\textasciitilde} 1.78 +/- 0.12. Using this luminosity function and assuming pure luminosity evolution of the form {\textasciitilde}(1 +z)3.3 we estimate a contribution to the X-ray background from normal galaxies of {\textasciitilde}10-20 per cent (0.5-8keV). Finally, we derive, for the first time, the luminosity functions for early- and late-type systems separately.},

We present an analytical expression for the overall behavior of the XLF in terms of the luminosity-dependent density evolution, smoothed two-power-law expressions in 11 redshift shells, three-segment power-law expression of the number density evolution in four luminosity classes, and binned XLF. We observe a sudden flattening of the low luminosity end slope of the XLF slope at z ≳0.6. Detailed structures of the AGN downsizing have also been revealed, where the number density curves have two clear breaks at all luminosity classes above log \{\{L\}X\} 43.

We consider the hard and soft X-ray samples separately and find that the XLF based on either (initially neglecting absorption effects) is best described by a new flexible model parametrization where the break luminosity, normalization, and faint-end slope all evolve with redshift. We then incorporate absorption effects, separately modelling the evolution of the XLFs of unabsorbed (20 {\textless} log NH {\textless} 22) and absorbed (22 {\textless} log NH {\textless} 24) AGNs, seeking a model that can reconcile both the hard- and soft-band samples. We find that the absorbed AGN XLF has a lower break luminosity, a higher normalization, and a steeper faint-end slope than the unabsorbed AGN XLF out to z ∼ 2. Hence, absorbed AGNs dominate at low luminosities, with the absorbed fraction falling rapidly as luminosity increases. Both XLFs undergo strong luminosity evolution which shifts the transition in the absorbed fraction to higher luminosities at higher redshifts. The evolution in the shape of the total XLF is primarily driven by the changing mix of unabsorbed and absorbed populations.},

In addition to a straightforward 1/V max approach, we also compute the intrinsic distributions, accounting for sample truncation by employing a forward-modeling approach to recover the observed BHMF and ERDF. As previous BHMFs and ERDFs have been robustly determined only for samples of bright, broad-line (Type 1) AGNs and/or quasars, ours are the first directly observationally constrained BHMF and ERDF of Type 2 AGNs. We find that after accounting for all observational biases, the intrinsic ERDF of Type 2 AGNs is significantly more skewed toward lower Eddington ratios than the intrinsic ERDF of Type 1 AGNs. This result supports the radiation-regulated unification scenario, in which radiation pressure dictates the geometry of the dusty obscuring structure around an AGN. Calculating the ERDFs in two separate mass bins, we verify that the derived shape is consistent, validating the assumption that the ERDF (shape) is mass-independent. We report the local AGN duty cycle as a function of mass and Eddington ratio, by comparing the BASS active BHMF with the local mass function for all supermassive black holes.

	abstract = {In this work, our aim is to investigate the star formation rate (SFR) of the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe. To this end, we constructed a sample of 149 luminous (L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2 − 10 keV{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}44{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) X-ray AGNs at z ≥ 3.5 selected in three fields with different depths and observed areas from the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey, XMM-XXL North, and eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey. We built their spectral energy distributions (SED) using the available multi-wavelength photometry from X-rays up to the far-IR. Then, we estimated the stellar mass, M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and the SFR of the AGNs using the X-CIGALE SED fitting algorithm. After applying several quality criteria, we ended up with 89 high-z sources. More than half (55\%) of the X-ray sample have spectroscopic redshifts. Based on our analysis, our high-z X-ray AGNs live in galaxies with a median M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 5.6 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and SFR{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≈ 240 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The majority of the high-z sources (∼89\%) were found inside or above the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies. Estimations of the normalised SFR, SFR{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}NORM{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, defined as the ratio of the SFR of AGNs, to the SFR of MS galaxies, show that the SFR of AGNs is enhanced by a factor of ∼1.8 compared to non-AGN star-forming systems. Combining our results with previous studies at lower redshifts, we confirmed that SFR{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}NORM{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} does not evolve with redshift. Using the specific black hole accretion rate (i.e. L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} divided by M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), λ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BHAR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, which can be used as a tracer of the Eddington ratio, we found that the majority of AGNs that lie inside or above the MS have higher specific accretion rates compared to sources below the MS. Finally, we found indications that the SFR of the most massive AGN host galaxies (log (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&gt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}11.5 − 12{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) remains roughly constant as a function of M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, in agreement with the SFR of MS star-forming galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present a new Bayesian method for reconstructing the parent distributions of X-ray spectral parameters of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in large surveys. The method uses the probability distribution function (PDF) of posteriors obtained by fitting a consistent physical model to each object with a Bayesian method. The PDFs are often broadly distributed and may present systematic biases, such that naive point estimators or even some standard parametric modeling are not sufficient to reconstruct the parent population without obvious bias. Our method uses a transfer function computed from a large realistic simulation with the same selection as in the actual sample to redistribute the stacked PDF and then forward-fit a nonparametric model to it in a Bayesian way, so that the biases in the PDFs are properly taken into account. In this way, we are able to accurately reconstruct the parent distributions. We apply our spectral fitting and population inference methods to the XMM-COSMOS survey as a pilot study. For the 819 AGN detected in the COSMOS field, 663 (81\%) of which have spectroscopic redshifts (spec-z) and the others high-quality photometric redshifts (photo-z), we find prominent bi-modality with widely separated peaks in the distribution of the absorbing hydrogen column density (N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and an indication that absorbed AGN have harder photon indices. A clear decreasing trend of the absorbed AGN fraction versus the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is observed, but there is no clear evolution in the absorbed fraction with redshift. Our method is designed to be readily applicable to large AGN samples such as the XXL survey, and eventually eROSITA.},

	abstract = {X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) consist of several different emission and absorption components. To determine the spectral parameters, these components are often fitted manually with models chosen on a case-by-case basis. However, this approach has two problems. First, it becomes very hard for a survey with a large number of sources. Second, when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is low, there is a tendency to adopt an overly simplistic model, biasing the parameters and making their uncertainties unrealistic. We developed a Bayesian method for automatically fitting AGN X-ray spectra obtained by XMM-Newton with a consistent and physically motivated model. Our model includes all spectral components, even when the data quality is low. We used a physical model for the X-ray background and an empirical model for the non-X-ray background. Noninformative priors were applied on the parameters of interest, the photon index (Γ) and the hydrogen column density (N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), while informative priors obtained from deep surveys were used to marginalize over the parameter space of the nuisance parameters. To improve speed, we developed a specific spectral extraction and fitting procedure. We tested this method using a realistic sample of 5000 spectra, which was simulated based on our source model, reproducing typical population properties. Spectral parameters were randomly drawn from the priors, taking the luminosity function into account. Well-constrained or meaningful posterior probability density distributions (PDFs) were obtained for the most relevant spectral parameters, for instance, N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Γ, and L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, even at low S/N, but in this case, we were unable to constrain the parameters of secondary components such as the reflection and soft excess. As a comparison, a maximum-likelihood approach with model selection among six models of different complexities was also applied to this sample. We find clear failures in the measurement of Γ in most cases, and of N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} when the source is unabsorbed (N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}22{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). The results can hardly be used to reconstruct the parent distributions of the spectral parameters, while our Bayesian method provides meaningful multidimensional posteriors that will be used in a subsequent paper to infer the population.},

	abstract = {A complete census of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a prerequisite for understanding the growth of supermassive black holes across cosmic time. A significant challenge towards this goal is the whereabouts of heavily obscured AGN that remain uncertain. This paper sets new constraints on the demographics of this population by developing a methodology that combines X-ray spectral information with priors derived from multiwavelength observations. We select X-ray AGN in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey and fit their \$2.2{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!500{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$ spectral energy distributions with galaxy and AGN templates to determine the mid-infrared (\$6{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$) luminosity of the AGN component. Empirical correlations between X-ray and \$6{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$ luminosities are then adopted to infer the intrinsic accretion luminosity at X-rays for individual AGN. This is used as prior information in our Bayesian X-ray spectral analysis to estimate physical properties, such as line-of-sight obscuration. Our approach breaks the degeneracies between accretion luminosity and obscuration that affect X-ray spectral analysis, particularly for the most heavily obscured (Compton-Thick) AGN with low photon counts X-ray spectra. The X-ray spectral results are then combined with the selection function of the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey to derive the AGN space density and a Compton-Thick fraction of \$21.0{\textasciicircum}\{+16.1\}\_\{-9.9\}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ at redshifts z {\textless} 0.5. At higher redshift, our analysis suggests upper limits to the Compton-Thick AGN fraction of \${\textbackslash}lesssim 40\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$. These estimates are at the low end of the range of values determined in the literature and underline the importance of multiwavelength approaches for tackling the challenge of heavily obscured AGN demographics.},

Of the 6181 unique X-ray sources in this field, we analyze a sample of 2937 candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with solid redshifts and sufficient counts determined by simulations.

The average obscured AGN fraction is 57\% ± 4\% for log L X/erg s-1 {\textgreater} 43. This work constrains the AGN obscuration and spectral shape of the still uncertain high-luminosity and high-redshift regimes (log L X/erg s-1 {\textgreater} 45.5, z {\textgreater} 3), where the obscured AGN fraction rises to 64\% ± 12\%. We report a luminosity and density evolution of the X-ray luminosity function, with obscured AGNs dominating at all luminosities at z {\textgreater} 2, and unobscured sources prevailing at log L X/erg s-1 {\textgreater} 45 at lower redshifts. Our results agree with the evolutionary models in which the bulk of AGN activity is triggered by gas-rich environments and in a downsizing scenario. Moreover, the black hole accretion density (BHAD) is found to evolve similarly to the star formation rate density, confirming the coevolution between AGN and host galaxy, but suggesting different timescales in their growing history. The derived BHAD evolution shows that Compton-thick AGNs contribute to the accretion history of AGNs as much as all other AGN populations combined.},

In this work, we place limits on the bright-end of the XLF at z = 5.7-6.4 using high-redshift AGN identified within the Extragalactic Serendipitous Swift Survey (ExSeSS) catalogue. Within ExSeSS, we find one serendipitously X-ray detected z {\textgreater} 6 AGN, ATLAS J025.6821-33.4627, with an X-ray luminosity of \$L\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{X\}=8.47{\textasciicircum}\{+3.40\}\_\{-3.13\}{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{44\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg.s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ and z = 6.31 ± 0.03, making it the highest redshift, spectroscopically confirmed, serendipitously X-ray detected quasar known to date. We also calculate an upper limit on the space density at higher luminosities where no additional sources are found, enabling us to place constraints on the shape of the XLF. Our results are consistent with the rapid decline in the space densities of high-luminosity AGN towards high redshift as predicted by extrapolations of existing parametric models of the XLF. We also find that our X-ray based measurements are consistent with estimates of the bolometric quasar luminosity function based on UV measurements at z ≳ 6, although they require a large X-ray to bolometric correction factor at these high luminosities.},

A sample of 73 AGNs, with redshifts of z {\textless} 2.5, is subdivided based on the optical spectra into subgroups of type 1 and 2 AGNs and no-AGN. The X-CIGALE code is used to produce the SEDs of these galaxies, fitting them with their observed flux densities. Accordingly, this code provides estimates of the physical properties, including the stellar mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio, far-UV attenuation, star-formation rate, and luminosity. All these properties and luminosity components, namely stellar, AGN, X-ray, and dust luminosities, are characterized versus the redshift. With the caveat that the sample is flux-limited and thus is affected by Malmquist bias, the results show that these properties increase as a function of redshift with various variation rates for each galaxy group, except for the far-UV attenuation of type 1 AGNs, which shows a slight reduction with redshift. The stellar, AGN, and X-ray luminosities show tight correlations with the intrinsic AGN luminosity, which is, in principle, attributed to the intrinsic AGN accretion power acting as a fuelling source. This power has an impact on most other correlations versus the redshift when the intrinsic AGN luminosity increases with redshift. Owing to their different emission sources, these luminosities make different fractional contributions to the total luminosity. The stellar luminosity, where the dust luminosity is the most effective, has the highest contribution of all galaxy groups, while the AGN luminosity has the lowest.},

SMBHs grew by accreting material from their surroundings, emitting X-rays as they did so. X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in order to understand the AGN population's cosmological properties and evolution. We present a new fixed rest-frame method to achieve a more accurate study of the AGN XLF evolution over cosmic time. Normally, XLFs are constructed in a fixed observer-frame energy band, which can be problematic because it probes different rest-frame energies at different redshifts. In the new method, we construct XLFs in the fixed rest-frame band instead, by varying the observed energy band with redshift. We target a rest-frame 2-8 keV band using XMM-Newton and HEAO 1 X-ray data, with seven observer-frame energy bands that vary with redshift for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 3. We produce the XLFs using two techniques; one to construct a binned XLF, and one using a maximum likelihood (ML) fit, which makes use of the full unbinned source sample. We find that our ML best-fitting pure luminosity evolution results for both methods are consistent with each other, suggesting that performing XLF evolution studies with the high-redshift data limited to high-luminosity AGN is not very sensitive to the choice of fixed observer-frame or rest-frame energy band, which is consistent with our expectation that high-luminosity AGN typically show little ABSORPTION. We have demonstrated the viability of the new method in measuring the XLF evolution.},

At earlier cosmic epochs, the picture has been largely inferred from UV-selected galaxies (e.g., Lyman-break galaxies; LBGs). However, the inferred star formation rates of LBGs strongly depend on the assumed dust extinction correction, which is not well constrained at high z, while observations in the radio domain are not affected by this issue. In this work we measure the SFRD from a 1.4 GHz selected sample of {\textasciitilde}600 galaxies in the GOODS-N field up to redshift {\textasciitilde}3.5. We take into account the contribution of active galactic nuclei from the infrared-radio correlation. We measure the radio luminosity function, fitted with a modified Schechter function, and derive the SFRD. The cosmic SFRD shows an increase up to z {\textasciitilde} 2 and then an almost flat plateau up to z {\textasciitilde} 3.5. Our SFRD is in agreement with those from other far-IR/radio surveys and a factor 2 higher than those from LBG samples.

            SciPy is an open-source scientific computing library for the Python programming language. Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.},

Nearly all of the classical double sources at redshifts less than 0.5 have bridges linking the central galaxy with the outer edge of the source, and maps of these objects show that two-thirds of the bridge are significantly distorted near the central galaxy. Such distortions may be predicted from the jet model for double radio sources if the jet is much lighter than the confining medium, since the dynamics of the bridge region are then dominated by backflow of material that has passed through the hotspots. There is a correlation between axial ratio and luminosity which may be physically related to the compactness relation of Jenkins \& McEllin (1977).},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z {\textgreater} 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z {\textasciitilde} 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

The number of astronomical objects identified at z {\textgreater} 6 has increased dramatically over the last few years, but previously only three radio-loud (R2500 = fν,5 GHz/fν,2500 Å {\textgreater} 10) sources had been reported at z {\textgreater} 6, with the most distant being a quasar at z = 6.18. Here we present the discovery and characterization of PSO J172.3556+18.7734, a radio-loud quasar at z = 6.823. This source has an Mg II-based black hole mass of ∼3 × 108 M⊙ and is one of the fastest accreting quasars, consistent with super-Eddington accretion. The ionized region around the quasar is among the largest measured at these redshifts, implying an active phase longer than the average lifetime of the z ≳ 6 quasar population. From archival data, there is evidence that its 1.4 GHz emission has decreased by a factor of two over the last two decades. The quasar's radio spectrum between 1.4 and 3.0 GHz is steep (α = -1.31). Assuming the measured radio slope and extrapolating to rest-frame 5 GHz, the quasar has a radio-loudness parameter R2500 ∼ 90. A second steep radio source (α = -0.83) of comparable brightness to the quasar is only 23"1 away (∼120 kpc at z = 6.82; projection probability {\textless}2\%), but shows no optical or near-infrared counterpart.

	abstract = {Surveys with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered candidate galaxies in the first 400 Myr of cosmic time. The properties of these distant galaxies provide initial conditions for understanding early galaxy formation and cosmic reionisation. Preliminary indications have suggested these candidate galaxies may be more massive and abundant than previously thought. However, without spectroscopic confirmation of their distances to constrain their intrinsic brightnesses, their inferred properties remain uncertain. Here we report on four galaxies located in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging with photometric redshifts \$z{\textbackslash}sim10-13\$ subsequently confirmed by JADES JWST Near- Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations. These galaxies include the first redshift \$z{\textgreater}12\$ systems both discovered and spectroscopically confirmed by JWST. Using stellar population modelling, we find the galaxies typically contain a hundred million solar masses in stars, in stellar populations that are less than one hundred million years old. The moderate star formation rates and compact sizes suggest elevated star formation rate surface densities, a key indicator of their formation pathways. Taken together, these measurements show that the first galaxies contributing to cosmic reionisation formed rapidly and with intense internal radiation fields.},

We build upon our successful pilot study, presenting a new sample of low-frequency-selected candidate high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) over a sky area 20 times larger. We have refined our selection technique, in which we select sources with curved radio spectra between 72–231 MHz from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. In combination with the requirements that our GLEAM-selected HzRG candidates have compact radio morphologies and be undetected in near-infrared \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ -band imaging from the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey, we find 51 new candidate HzRGs over a sky area of approximately \$1200{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ . Our sample also includes two sources from the pilot study: the second-most distant radio galaxy currently known, at \$z=5.55\$ , with another source potentially at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 8\$ . We present our refined selection technique and analyse the properties of the sample. We model the broadband radio spectra between 74 MHz and 9 GHz by supplementing the GLEAM data with both publicly available data and new observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 5.5 and 9 GHz. In addition, deep \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ -band imaging from the High-Acuity Widefield K-band Imager (HAWK-I) on the Very Large Telescope and from the Southern Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey Regions \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ -band Survey (SHARKS) is presented for five sources.

The sources were selected to have S\_1.4mm{\textgreater}20 mJy and a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio (S\_843MHz{\textless}6mJy) or far-infrared counterparts (S\_100um{\textless}1 Jy, S\_60um{\textless}200mJy). We robustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshifted emission lines of 12CO, 13CO, [CI], H2O, and H2O+. We find one or more spectral features in 23 sources yielding a {\textasciitilde}90\% detection rate for this survey; in 12 of these sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only a single line. For the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshift degeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or infer the most likely line identification based on photometric data. This yields secure redshifts for {\textasciitilde}70\% of the sample. The three sources with no lines detected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7{\textless}z{\textless}2.0. The resulting mean redshift of our sample is {\textless}z{\textgreater}=3.5. This finding is in contrast to the redshift distribution of radio-identified DSFGs, which have a significantly lower mean redshift of {\textless}z{\textgreater}=2.3 and for which only 10-15\% of the population is expected to be at z{\textgreater}3. We discuss the effect of gravitational lensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshift distribution to that of models in the literature.},

Using this sample, we derive the AGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function has a double power law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude \$M\_*\$ of the AGN luminosity function shows a steep brightening from \$M\_*{\textbackslash}sim -24\$ at z=0.7 to \$M\_*{\textbackslash}sim -29\$ at z=6. The faint-end slope \${\textbackslash}beta\$ significantly steepens from \$-1.7\$ at \$z{\textless}2.2\$ to \$-2.4\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 6\$. In spite of this steepening, the contribution of AGN to the hydrogen photoionization rate at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 6\$ is subdominant ({\textless} 3\%), although it can be non-negligible ({\textasciitilde}10\%) if these luminosity functions hold down to \$M\_\{1450\}=-18\$. Under reasonable assumptions, AGN can reionize HeII by redshift z=2.9. At low redshifts (z{\textless}0.5), AGN can produce about half of the hydrogen photoionization rate inferred from the statistics of HI absorption lines in the IGM. Our global analysis of the luminosity function also reveals important systematic errors in the data, particularly at z=2.2--3.5, which need to be addressed and incorporated in the AGN selection function in future in order to improve our results. We make various fitting functions, luminosity function analysis codes, and homogenised AGN data publicly available.},
