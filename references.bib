	abstract = {Our understanding of the redshift z {\textgreater} 3 galaxy population relies largely on samples selected using the popular "dropout" technique, typically consisting of UV-bright galaxies with blue colors and prominent Lyman breaks. As it is currently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxy population, we here use the FOURSTAR Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) survey to create a stellar mass-limited sample at z = 3-4. Uniquely, ZFOURGE uses deep near-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshifts and stellar population properties. The mass-complete sample consists of 57 galaxies with log M {\textgreater}10.6, reaching below M sstarf at z = 3-4. On average, the massive z = 3-4 galaxies are extremely faint in the observed optical with median R\_\{tot\}{\textasciicircum}\{AB\}=27.48+/- 0.41 (rest-frame M 1700 = -18.05 ± 0.37). They lie far below the UV luminosity-stellar mass relation for Lyman break galaxies and are about {\textasciitilde}100 × fainter at the same mass. The massive galaxies are red (R - K s AB = 3.9 ± 0.2; rest-frame UV-slope β = -0.2 ± 0.3) likely from dust or old stellar ages. We classify the galaxy spectral energy distributions by their rest-frame U-V and V-J colors and find a diverse population: 46{\textasciicircum}\{+6+10\}\_\{-6-17\}\% of the massive galaxies are quiescent, 40{\textasciicircum}\{+6+7\}\_\{-6-5\}\% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only 14{\textasciicircum}\{+3+10\}\_\{-3-4\}\% resemble luminous blue star-forming Lyman break galaxies. This study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies at higher redshift than previously known. Furthermore, we uncover a reservoir of dusty star-forming galaxies with 4 × lower specific star-formation rates compared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at z {\textgreater} 3. With 5 × higher numbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formation compared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.

	abstract = {Nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly. Herschel-SPIRE provides sampling of the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of type 1 and type 2 AGN, allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust (starburst) emission. We study large samples of spectroscopically confirmed type 1 and type 2 AGN lying within the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aiming to understand their FIR colour distributions and constrain their starburst contributions. We find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed AGN in the HerMES fields have 5σ detections at 250 μm, in agreement with previous (sub)mm AGN studies. Their combined Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-SPIRE colours (specifically S250/S70 vs S70/S24) quite clearly separate them from the non-AGN, star forming galaxy population, as their 24 μm flux is dominated by the hot torus emission. However, their SPIRE colours alone do not differ from those of non-AGN galaxies. SED fitting shows that all those AGN need a starburst component to fully account for their FIR emission. For objects at z {\textgreater} 2 we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to the starburst component, LSB, and the AGN accretion luminosity, Lacc, with LSB ∝ Lacc0.35. Type 2 AGN detected at 250 μm show on average higher LSB than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establish whether this trend indicates stronger star formation activity. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	abstract = {The energy released by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the form of radiation, winds or radio plasma jets, is known to impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. The result of these processes, known as AGN (negative) feedback, is suggested to prevent gas, in and around galaxies, from cooling, and to remove, or at least redistribute, gas by driving massive and fast outflows, hence playing a key role in galaxy evolution. Given its importance, a large effort is devoted by the astronomical community to trace the effects of AGN on the surrounding gaseous medium and to quantify their impact for different types of AGN. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent observational results obtained in different wavebands, tracing different phases of the gas. I also summarise new insights they have brought, and the constraints they provide to numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. The recent addition of deep observations of cold gas and, in particular, of cold molecular gas, has brought some interesting surprises and has expanded our understanding of AGN and AGN feedback.},

	abstract = {Feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is often divided into quasar and radio mode, powered by radiation or radio jets, respectively. Both are fundamental in galaxy evolution, especially in late-type galaxies, as shown by cosmological simulations and observations of jet-ISM (interstellar medium) interactions in these systems. We compare AGN feedback by radiation and by collimated jets through a suite of simulations, in which a central AGN interacts with a clumpy, fractal galactic disc. We test AGNs of 1043 and 1046 erg s-1, considering jets perpendicular or parallel to the disc. Mechanical jets drive the more powerful outflows, exhibiting stronger mass and momentum coupling with the dense gas, while radiation heats and rarefies the gas more. Radiation and perpendicular jets evolve to be quite similar in outflow properties and effect on the cold ISM, while inclined jets interact more efficiently with all the disc gas, removing the densest 20 \{per cent\} in 20 Myr, and thereby reducing the amount of cold gas available for star formation. All simulations show small-scale inflows of 0.01-0.1 M⊙ yr-1, which can easily reach down to the Bondi radius of the central supermassive black hole (especially for radiation and perpendicular jets), implying that AGNs modulate their own duty cycle in a feedback/feeding cycle.},

	abstract = {Detailed studies of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of normal galaxies have increasingly been used to understand the physical mechanism dominating their integrated emission, mainly owing to the availability of high quality multi-wavelength data from the UV to the far-infrared (FIR). However, systems hosting dust-enshrouded nuclear starbursts and/or an accreting supermassive black hole (an active galactic nucleus or AGN) are especially challenging to study. This is due to the complex interplay between the heating by massive stars and the AGN, the absorption and emission of radiation from dust, as well as the presence of the underlying old stellar population. We used the latest release of CIGALE, a fast state-of-the-art galaxy SED-fitting model relying on energy balance, to study the influence of an AGN in a self consistent manner in estimating both the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass in galaxies, as well as to calculate the contribution of the AGN to the power output of the host. Using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform, we created a suite of mock galaxy SEDs using realistic star formation histories (SFH). We also added an AGN of Type-1, Type-2, or intermediate-type whose contribution to the bolometric luminosity can be variable. We performed an SED-fitting of these catalogues with CIGALE, assuming three different SFHs: a single-exponentially-decreasing (1τ-dec), a double-exponentially-decreasing (2τ-dec), and a delayed SFH. Constraining the overall contribution of an AGN to the total infrared luminosity (fracAGN) is very challenging for fracAGN{\textless} 20\%, with uncertainties of {\textasciitilde}5-30\% for higher fractions depending on the AGN type, while FIR and sub-mm are essential. The AGN power has an impact on the estimation of M∗ in Type-1 and intermediate-type AGNs but has no effect on galaxies hosting Type-2 AGNs. We find that in the absence of AGN emission, the best estimates of M∗ are obtained using the 2τ-dec model but at the expense of realistic ages of the stellar population. The delayed SFH model provides good estimates of M∗ and SFR, with a maximum offset of 10\% as well as better estimates of the age. Our analysis shows that the under-estimation of the SFR increases with fracAGN for Type-1 systems, as well as for low contributions of an intermediate AGN type, but it is quite insensitive to the emission of Type-2 AGNs up to fracAGN {\textasciitilde} 45\%. A lack of sampling the FIR, or sub-mm domain systematically over-estimates the SFR ({\textless}20\%), independent of the contribution of the AGN. Similarly, the UV emission is critical in accurately retrieving both the M∗ for Type-1 and intermediate- type AGN and the SFR of all three AGN types. We show that the presence of AGN emission introduces a scatter to the SFR-M∗ main sequence relation derived from SED-fitting, which is driven by the uncertainties on M∗. Finally, we used our mock catalogues to test the popular IR SED-fitting code DecompIR and show that fracAGN is under-estimated but that the SFR is recovered well for Type-1 and intermediate-types of AGN. The fracAGN, SFR, and LIR estimates of Type-2 AGNs are more problematic owing to a FIR emission disagreement between predicted and observed models.},

	abstract = {Modern and future surveys effectively provide a panchromatic view for large numbers of extragalactic objects. Consistently modeling these multiwavelength survey data is a critical but challenging task for extragalactic studies. The Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE) is an efficient PYTHON code for spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Recently, a major extension of CIGALE (named X-CIGALE) has been developed to account for AGN/galaxy X-ray emission and improve AGN modeling at UV-to-IR wavelengths. Here, we apply X-CIGALE to different samples, including Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) spectroscopic type 2 AGNs, Chandra Deep Field-South X-ray detected normal galaxies, Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars, and COSMOS radio objects. From these tests, we identify several weaknesses of X-CIGALE and improve the code accordingly. These improvements are mainly related to AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy, X-ray binary emission, AGN accretion-disk SED shape, and AGN radio emission. These updates improve the fit quality and allow for new interpretation of the results, based on which we discuss physical implications. For example, we find that AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy is moderate, and can be modeled as \$\{L\}\_\{X\}({\textbackslash}theta ){\textbackslash}propto 1+{\textbackslash}cos {\textbackslash}theta \$ , where θ is the viewing angle measured from the AGN axis. We merge the new code into the major branch of CIGALE, and publicly release this new version as CIGALE V2022.0 on https://cigale.lam.fr.},

We develop a new X-ray module for CIGALE, allowing it to fit SEDs from the X-ray to infrared (IR). We also improve the AGN fitting of CIGALE from UV-to-IR wavelengths. We implement a modern clumpy two-phase torus model, SKIRTOR. To account for moderately extincted type 1 AGNs, we implement polar-dust extinction. We publicly release the source code (named 'X-CIGALE'). We test X-CIGALE with X-ray detected AGNs in SDSS, COSMOS, and AKARI-NEP. The fitting quality (as indicated by reduced χ2) is good in general, indicating that X-CIGALE is capable of modelling the observed SED from X-ray to IR. We discuss constrainability and degeneracy of model parameters in the fitting of AKARI-NEP, for which excellent mid-IR photometric coverage is available. We also test fitting a sample of AKARI-NEP galaxies for which only X-ray upper limits are available from Chandra observations, and find that the upper limit can effectively constrain the AGN SED contribution for some systems. Finally, using X-CIGALE, we assess the ability of Athena to constrain the AGN activity in future extragalactic studies.},

The most successful tool for identifying ultra-high-redshift candidates and inferring their properties is photometric template fitting. However, current methods rely on templates derived from much lower-redshift conditions, including stellar populations older than the age of the Universe at z {\textgreater} 12, a stellar initial mass function that is physically disallowed at z {\textgreater} 6, and weaker emission lines than currently observed at z {\textgreater} 7.5. Here, two sets of synthetic templates, optimized for the expected astrophysics of galaxies at 8 {\textless} z {\textless} 12 and z {\textgreater} 12, are developed and used to fit three galaxies at z {\textgreater} 12 from the SMACS0723 field. Using these improved templates, quantitative estimates are produced of the bias in inferred properties from JWST observations at z {\textgreater} 8 due to these effects. The best-fit redshifts are similar to those found with previous template sets, but the inferred stellar masses drop by as much as 1-1.6 dex, such that stellar masses are no longer seemingly inconsistent with ΛCDM. The two new template sets are released in formats compatible with EAZY and LEPHARE.},

They provide means to extract stellar masses, stellar ages, star formation histories, chemical enrichment, and dust content of galaxies from their integrated spectral energy distributions, colours, or spectra. As most models, they contain uncertainties that can hamper our ability to model and interpret observed spectra. This work aims at studying a specific source of model uncertainty: the choice of an empirical versus a synthetic stellar spectral library. Empirical libraries suffer from limited coverage of parameter space, while synthetic libraries suffer from modelling inaccuracies. Given our current inability to have both ideal stellar-parameter coverage with ideal stellar spectra, what should one favour: better coverage of the parameters (synthetic library) or better spectra on a star-by-star basis (empirical library)? To study this question, we build a synthetic stellar library mimicking the coverage of an empirical library, and SPS models with different choices of stellar library tailored to these investigations. Through the comparison of model predictions and the spectral fitting of a sample of nearby galaxies, we learned that predicted colours are more affected by the coverage effect than the choice of a synthetic versus empirical library; the effects on predicted spectral indices are multiple and defy simple conclusions; derived galaxy ages are virtually unaffected by the choice of the library, but are underestimated when SPS models with limited parameter coverage are used; metallicities are robust against limited HRD coverage, but are underestimated when using synthetic libraries.},

We perform 226 950 MAGPHYS SED fits to regions between 0.2 and 25 kpc in size across the galaxy's disc, viewed from three different sight-lines, to probe how well MAGPHYS can recover key galaxy properties based on 21 bands of UV-far-infrared model photometry. MAGPHYS yields statistically acceptable fits to {\textgreater}99 per cent of the pixels within the r-band effective radius and between 59 and 77 percent of pixels within 20 kpc of the nucleus. MAGPHYS is able to recover the distribution of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, dust luminosity, dust mass, and V-band attenuation reasonably well, especially when the pixel size is ≳ 1 kpc, whereas non-standard outputs (stellar metallicity and mass-weighted age) are recovered less well. Accurate recovery is more challenging in the smallest sub-regions of the disc (pixel scale ≲ 1 kpc), where the energy balance criterion becomes increasingly incorrect. Estimating integrated galaxy properties by summing the recovered pixel values, the true integrated values of all parameters considered except metallicity and age are well recovered at all spatial resolutions, ranging from 0.2 kpc to integrating across the disc, albeit with some evidence for resolution-dependent biases. These results must be considered when attempting to analyse the structure of real galaxies with actual observational data, for which the `ground truth' is unknown.},

	abstract = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

	abstract = {We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three components: a component of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); a mid-infrared continuum characterizing the emission from hot grains at temperatures in the range 130-250 K; and a component of grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 30-60 K. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 15-25 K. Our model is both simple and versatile enough that it can be used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using a wide range of ultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. We illustrate this by deriving median likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses and relative strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star-forming galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). We explore how the constraints derived in this way depend on the available spectral information. From our analysis of the SINGS sample, we conclude that the mid- and far-infrared colours of galaxies correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter, such as the ratio of infrared luminosity between stellar birth clouds and the ambient ISM, the contributions by PAHs and grains in thermal equilibrium to the total infrared emission, and the ratio of dust mass to stellar mass. Our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample.},

	abstract = {Galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling is a powerful tool, but constraining how well it is able to infer the true values for galaxy properties (e.g. the star formation rate) is difficult because independent determinations are often not available. However, galaxy simulations can provide a means of testing SED modelling techniques. Here, we present a numerical experiment in which we apply the SED modelling code MAGPHYS to ultraviolet-millimetre synthetic photometry generated from hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated disc galaxy and a major galaxy merger by performing three-dimensional dust radiative transfer. We compare the properties inferred from the SED modelling with the true values and find that MAGPHYS recovers most physical parameters of the simulated galaxies well. In particular, it recovers consistent parameters irrespective of the viewing angle, with smoothly varying results for neighbouring time steps of the simulation, even though each viewing angle and time step is modelled independently. The notable exception to this rule occurs when we use a Small Magellanic Cloud-type intrinsic dust extinction curve in the radiative transfer calculations. In this case, the two-component dust model used by MAGPHYS is unable to effectively correct for the attenuation of the simulated galaxies, which leads to potentially significant errors (although we obtain only marginally acceptable fits in this case). Overall, our results give confidence in the ability of SED modelling to infer physical properties of galaxies, albeit with some caveats.},

	abstract = {The Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade (WSU) is the top priority initiative for the ALMA2030 Development Roadmap. The WSU will initially double, and eventually quadruple, ALMA's system bandwidth and will deliver improved sensitivity by upgrading the receivers, digital electronics and correlator. The WSU will afford significant improvements for every future ALMA observation, whether it is for continuum or spectral line science. The continuum imaging speed will increase by a factor of 3 for the 2\${\textbackslash}times\$ bandwidth upgrade, plus any gains from improved receiver temperatures. The spectral line imaging speed will improve by a factor of 2-3. The improvements provided by the WSU will be most dramatic for high spectral resolution observations, where the instantaneous bandwidth correlated at 0.1-0.2 kms resolution will increase by 1-2 orders of magnitude in most receiver bands. The improved sensitivity and spectral tuning grasp will open new avenues of exploration and enable more efficient observations. The impact will span the vast array of topics that embodies ALMA's motto In Search of our Cosmic Origins. The WSU will greatly expand the chemical inventory of protoplanetary disks, which will have profound implications for how and when planets form. Observations of the interstellar medium will measure a variety of molecular species to build large samples of clouds, cores and protostars. The WSU will also enable efficient surveys of galaxies at high redshift. The first elements of the WSU will be available later this decade, including a wideband Band 2 receiver, a wideband upgrade to Band 6, new digitizers and digital transmission system, and a new correlator. Other upgrades are under study, including the newly developed ACA spectrometer and upgrades to Bands 9 and 10. The gains enabled by the WSU will further enhance ALMA as the world leading facility for millimeter/submillimeter astronomy.},

	abstract = {Unobscured quasars (QSOs) are predicted to be the final stage in the evolutionary sequence from gas-rich mergers to gas-depleted, quenched galaxies. Studies of this population, however, find a high incidence of far-infrared-luminous sources-suggesting significant dust-obscured star formation-but direct observations of the cold molecular gas fuelling this star formation are still necessary. We present a NOEMA study of CO(2-1) emission, tracing the cold molecular gas, in ten lensed z = 1 − 1.5 unobscured QSOs. We detected CO(2-1) in seven of our targets, four of which also show continuum emission (λrest = 1.3 mm). After subtracting the foreground galaxy contribution to the photometry, spectral energy distribution fitting yielded stellar masses of 109 − 11 M⊙, with star formation rates of 25−160 M⊙ yr−1 for the host galaxies. These QSOs have lower LCO' than star-forming galaxies with the same LIR, and show depletion times spanning a large range (50−900 Myr), but with a median of just 90(αCO/4) Myr. We find molecular gas masses in the range ≤2−40 × 109(αCO/4) M⊙, which suggest gas fractions above ∼50\% for most of the targets. Despite the presence of an unobscured QSO, the host galaxies are able to retain significant amounts of cold gas. However, with a median depletion time of ∼90 Myr, the intense burst of star formation taking place in these targets will quickly deplete their molecular gas reservoirs in the absence of gas replenishment, resulting in a quiescent host galaxy. The non-detected QSOs are three of the four radio-loud QSOs in the sample, and their properties indicate that they are likely already transitioning into quiescence. Recent cosmological simulations tend to overestimate the depletion times expected for these z ∼ 1 QSO-host galaxies, which is likely linked to their difficulty producing starbursts across the general high-redshift galaxy population.},

	abstract = {The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}bullet\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{6-10\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) in the first cosmic Gyr (\$zrsim 6\$) challenges current models of BH formation and evolution. We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume a non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models; these scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially formed in the high-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out of which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH accretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction. PBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense core, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading to the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 20-40\$ in rare halos (\$M\_h{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ corresponding to \${\textbackslash}sim 5-7{\textbackslash}sigma\$ fluctuations), and provides massive (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{4-5\}{\textasciitilde} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) seeds by \$z{\textbackslash}sim 10-30\$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that provides the mass of the seed, \$ M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm seed\}(z)=3.1{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash} \{ M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}[(1+z)/10]{\textasciicircum}\{-1.2\}\$, and seeded halo, \$ M\_\{h\}(z)=2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash} \{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}[(1+z)/10]{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-0.05z\}\$ as a function of redshift. This seeding mechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs, namely \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm PBH\}{\textbackslash}sim 3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$. We find that \$z{\textbackslash}sim 6-7\$ quasars can be explained with \$6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4 M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}odot\}\$ seeds planted at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 32\$, and growing at sub-Eddington rates, \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}sim 0.55\$. The same scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at \$z=10.6\$, while UHZ1 (\$z=10.1\$) and GHZ9 (\$z=10\$) data favour instead slightly later (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 20-25\$), more massive (\$10{\textasciicircum}5{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}odot\}\$) seeds.

	abstract = {High resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the hot gas in galaxy clusters has shown that the gas is not cooling to low temperatures at the predicted rates of hundreds to thousands of solar masses per year. X-ray images have revealed giant cavities and shock fronts in the hot gas that provide a direct and relatively reliable means of measuring the energy injected into hot atmospheres by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Average radio jet powers are near those required to offset radiative losses and to suppress cooling in isolated giant elliptical galaxies, and in larger systems up to the richest galaxy clusters. This coincidence suggests that heating and cooling are coupled by feedback, which suppresses star formation and the growth of luminous galaxies. How jet energy is converted to heat and the degree to which other heating mechanisms are contributing, e.g., thermal conduction, are not well understood. Outburst energies require substantial late growth of supermassive black holes. Unless all of the ∼1062 erg required to suppress star formation is deposited in the cooling regions of clusters, AGN outbursts must alter large-scale properties of the intracluster medium.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and the velocity dispersion σ of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from in brightest cluster ellipticals to in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade.New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105−106M⊙ are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution.The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present optical spectroscopic data on the ionized nebulae associated with 14 galaxies that are strong far-infrared emitters ("far-IR galaxies," or "FIRGs"). This sample includes the three nearest FIRGs (M82, NGC 253, and NGC 4945), three of the nearest and most famous examples of very luminous FIRGS with bolometric luminosities of nearly 10{\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum} L\_sun\_ (NGC 3690/IC 694, Apr 220, and NGC 6240), and the most luminous known FIRG (IRAS 00182-7112, L\_IR\_ {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum} L\_sun\_). We find that our data provide both qualitative and quantitative support for the "superwind" model in which the kinetic energy provided by supernovae and winds from massive stars in a central starburst drives a large-scale outflow that can shock heat and accelerate ambient interstellar or circumgalactic gas. For the three nearest FIRGs (all disk galaxies seen nearly edge-on) we find that clear kinematic signature of an outflow along the galaxy's minor axis. Kiloparsec-scale regions well out of the disk are characterized by double emission-line profiles with line splitting of 200-600 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. The emission-line gas evidently lies along the surface of an expanding bubble or outflowing conelike structure. Similar structures are present in the edge-on FIRG NGC 3079 and in the brighter "Hα bubble" in Arp 220. The gas in both NGC 6240 and IRAS 00182-7112 is very violently disturbed kinematically (lines having FWHW 600-1000 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} over galaxy-scale regions). The sizes, velocities, and kinematic/morphological structure of these outflows agree well with the superwind model, which predicts that the winds fluid will inflate an expanding cavity in the ISM of the FIRG, with optical line emission coming from the thin outer shell of shock- heated, swept-up ambient gas. We also find that the FIRG nebulae are highly overpressured (by three to four orders of magnitude) relative to the ISM of the Milky Way, with the pressures dropping systematically with distance from the nucleus. The radius at which a fiducial pressure occurs is proportional to the square root of the IR luminosity. In the best- studied cases, the shapes of the radial density/pressure profiles are shallow at radii of less than few hundred parsecs and steep at radii greater than 1 kpc. These results are all in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the superwind model (relatively constant, static thermal pressure inside the region of energy/mass injection and ram pressure proportional to the star-formation rate at large radii). The shapes of the pressure profiles are inconsistent with a wind driven by an AGN. The sizes of the mass/energy injection regions derived from the pressure profiles agree well with directly measured starburst radii, and the measured pressures at large radii are close to the predicted ram pressures for starburst-driven superwinds. We find that superwinds are energetically adequate to power both the observed optical and X-ray nebulae, and also show that the relative emission-line intensities and their radical variations are consistent with ionization by wind-driven shocks, but not with photoionization by normal O stars or an AGN. We discuss the possible astrophysical implications of superwinds. At the present epoch, a typical superwind may inject 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_ of metals and 10{\textasciicircum}58{\textasciicircum} ergs into the intergalactic medium (IGM) over its estimated lifetime of 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textasciicircum} yr. The local luminosity function for FIRGs implies that about 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_ of metals and 10{\textasciicircum}59{\textasciicircum} ergs could be injected, on average, per L\_8\_ galaxy over a Hubble time, even with no cosmic evolution in the superwind rate. Superwinds may play important or even dominant roles in the metal enrichment and heating of both the intracluster medium and general intergalactic medium. Superwinds may make an important contribution to the cosmic X-ray background, and their relationship to the QSO absorption-line phenomenon should be explored. We also speculate that superwinds may represent a phase in the evolution of a FIRG to a QSO/AGN and of a disk- disk galaxy merger to an elliptical galaxy. Finally, we emphasize that powerful FIRGs may be reasonable approximations to galaxies in formation. If so, then superwinds may be important during the process of galaxy formation, with particular relevance to the "explosions" or the "feedback" mechanisms suggested by Ostriker, Cowie, Ikeuchi, Dekel and Silk, White and others.},

Concentrating on radio-loud AGN, I show that the unified schemes based on anisotropy induced both by beaming in relativistic jets and by absorption in dusty torus structures, work well in a broad-brush sense. However, they represent simplifications of a situation that is, in reality, likely to be more complex. In particular, the AGN selected in radio flux limited samples encompass a wide range of intrinsic X-ray/UV/optical/infrared properties for a given radio power, reflecting a number of variable factors in addition to orientation (e.g. large scale environment, accretion rate onto central black hole). There is also a growing recognition that AGN are dynamic, evolving objects that strongly influence their immediate surroundings, including the distribution of circum-nuclear gas and dust.},

	abstract = {Most of the matter in the Universe appears to be in some form which does not emit or absorb light. While evidence for the existence of this dark matter has accumulated over the last seventy years, its nature remains elusive. In this thesis, quasars and low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) are used to investigate the properties of the dark matter. Quasars are extremely bright light sources which can be seen over vast distances. These cosmic beacons may be used to constrain dark matter in the form of low-mass, compact objects along the line of sight, as such objects are expected to induce brightness fluctuations in quasars through gravitational microlensing effects. Using a numerical microlensing model, we demonstrate that the uncertainty in the typical size of the optical continuum-emitting region in quasars represents the main obstacle in this procedure. We also show that, contrary to claims in the literature, microlensing fails to explain the observed long-term optical variability of quasars. Here, quasar distances are inferred from their redshifts, which are assumed to stem from the expansion of the Universe. Some astronomers do however defend the view that quasar redshifts could have a different origin. A number of potential methods for falsifying claims of such non-cosmological redshifts are proposed. As the ratio of dark to luminous matter is known to be unusually high in LSBGs, these objects have become the prime targets for probing dark matter halos around galaxies. Here, we use spectral evolutionary models to constrain the properties of the stellar populations in a class of unusually blue LSBGs. Using rotation curve data obtained at the ESO Very Large Telescope, we also investigate the density profiles of their dark halos. We find our measurements to be inconsistent with the predictions of the currently favoured cold dark matter scenario.},

	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are energetic astrophysical sources powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes in galaxies, and present unique observational signatures that cover the full electromagnetic spectrum over more than twenty orders of magnitude in frequency. The rich phenomenology of AGN has resulted in a large number of different "flavours" in the literature that now comprise a complex and confusing AGN "zoo". It is increasingly clear that these classifications are only partially related to intrinsic differences between AGN and primarily reflect variations in a relatively small number of astrophysical parameters as well the method by which each class of AGN is selected. Taken together, observations in different electromagnetic bands as well as variations over time provide complementary windows on the physics of different sub-structures in the AGN. In this review, we present an overview of AGN multi-wavelength properties with the aim of painting their "big picture" through observations in each electromagnetic band from radio to γ -rays as well as AGN variability. We address what we can learn from each observational method, the impact of selection effects, the physics behind the emission at each wavelength, and the potential for future studies. To conclude, we use these observations to piece together the basic architecture of AGN, discuss our current understanding of unification models, and highlight some open questions that present opportunities for future observational and theoretical progress.},

	abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z{\textasciitilde}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z{\textasciitilde}20 from high-σ density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a ΛCDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10\% to the total BH mass density, ρSMBH=4×105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 σ (4 σ) density peaks at z=20.},

This paper outlines how the scientific challenges are translated into technical challenges, how the application of recent technology offers the potential of affordably meeting these challenges, and how the choices of technology will ultimately be made. The SKA will be an array of coherently connected antennas spread over an area about 3000 km in extent, with an aggregate antenna collecting area of up to 10{\textasciicircum}6 m{\textasciicircum}2 at centimeter and meter wavelengths. A key scientific requirement is the ability to carry out sensitive observations of the sky over large areas (surveys).

	abstract = {Context. The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide imaging, coronagraphy, low-resolution spectroscopy, and medium-resolution spectroscopy at unprecedented sensitivity levels in the mid-infrared wavelength range. The Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) of MIRI is an integral field spectrograph that provides diffraction-limited spectroscopy between 4.9 and 28.3 μm, within a field of view (FOV) varying from ∼13 to ∼56 arcsec square. The design for MIRI MRS conforms with the goals of the JWST mission to observe high redshift galaxies and to study cosmology as well as observations of galactic objects, and stellar and planetary systems. Aims: From ground testing, we calculate the physical parameters essential for general observers and calibrating the wavelength solution and resolving power of the MRS which is critical for maximizing the scientific performance of the instrument. Methods: We have used ground-based observations of discrete spectral features in combination with Fabry-Perot etalon spectra to characterize the wavelength solution and spectral resolving power of the MRS. We present the methodology used to derive the MRS spectral characterization, which includes the precise wavelength coverage of each MRS sub-band, computation of the resolving power as a function of wavelength, and measuring slice-dependent spectral distortions. Results: The ground calibration of the MRS shows that it will cover the wavelength ranges from 4.9 to 28.3 μm, divided in 12 overlapping spectral sub-bands. The resolving power is R ≳ 3500 in channel 1, R ≳ 3000 in channel 2, R ≳ 2500 in channel 3, and R ≳ 1500 in channel 4. The MRS spectral resolution optimizes the sensitivity for detection of spectral features with a velocity width of ∼100 km s−1 which is characteristic of most astronomical phenomena JWST aims to study in the mid-infrared. Based on the ground test data, the wavelength calibration accuracy is estimated to be below one-tenth of a pixel (0.1 nm at 5 μm and 0.4 at 28 μm), with small systematic shifts due to the target position within a slice for unresolved sources that have a maximum amplitude of about 0.25 spectral resolution elements. The absolute wavelength calibration is presently uncertain at the level of 0.35 nm at 5 μm and 46 nm at 28 μm, and it will be refined using in-flight commissioning observations. Conclusions: Based on ground test data, the MRS complies with the spectral requirements for both the R and wavelength accuracy for which it was designed. We also present the commissioning strategies and targets that will be followed to update the spectral characterization of the MRS.},

We conduct this search by modelling photometric redshifts in several ways for all sources and by applying conservative magnitude cuts (mF200W {\textless} 28) to identify strong Lyman breaks greater than 1 mag. We find four z {\textgreater} 9 candidate galaxies which have not previously been identified, with one object at z = 11.5, and another which is possibly a close pair of galaxies. We measure redshifts for candidate galaxies from other studies and find the recovery rate to be only 23 per cent, with many being assigned lower redshift, dusty solutions in our work. Most of our z {\textgreater} 9 sample show evidence for Balmer-breaks, or extreme emission lines from H β and [O III], demonstrating that the stellar populations could be advanced in age or very young depending on the cause of the F444W excess. We discuss the resolved structures of these early galaxies and find that the Sérsic indices reveal a mixture of light concentration levels, but that the sizes of all our systems are exceptionally small ({\textless}0.5 kpc). These systems have stellar masses M* {\textasciitilde} 109.0 M⊙, with our z {\textasciitilde} 11.5 candidate a dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass M* {\textasciitilde} 107.8-108.2 M⊙.

	abstract = {The current hierarchical merging paradigm and ΛCDM predict that the z∼ 4-8 universe should be a time in which the most massive galaxies are transitioning from their initial halo assembly to the later baryonic evolution seen in star-forming galaxies and quasars. However, no evidence of this transition has been found in many high-redshift galaxy surveys including CFHTLS, Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Survey (CANDELS), and Spitzer Large Area Survey with Hyper-Suprime-Cam (SPLASH), which were the first studies to probe the high-mass end at these redshifts. Indeed, if halo mass to stellar mass ratios estimated at lower-redshift continue to z∼ 6-8, CANDELS and SPLASH report several orders of magnitude more M∼ \{10\}12-13\{M\}⊙ halos than is possible to have been formed by those redshifts, implying that these massive galaxies formed impossibly early. We consider various systematics in the stellar synthesis models used to estimate physical parameters and possible galaxy formation scenarios in an effort to reconcile observation with theory. Although known uncertainties can greatly reduce the disparity between recent observations and cold dark matter merger simulations, there remains considerable tension with current theory even if taking the most conservative view of the observations.},

At z{\textgreater} 4, galaxy stellar mass functions place lower limits on halo number densities that approach expected Lambda Cold Dark Matter halo mass functions. High-redshift galaxy stellar mass functions can thus place interesting limits on number densities of massive haloes, which are otherwise very difficult to measure. Although halo mass functions at z {\textless} 8 are consistent with observed galaxy stellar masses if galaxy baryonic conversion efficiencies increase with redshift, JWST(James Webb Space Telescope) and WFIRST(Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope) will more than double the redshift range over which useful constraints are available. We calculate maximum galaxy stellar masses as a function of redshift given expected halo number densities from ΛCDM. We apply similar arguments to black holes. If their virial mass estimates are accurate, number density constraints alone suggest that the quasars SDSS J1044-0125 and SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 likely have black hole mass to stellar mass ratios higher than the median z = 0 relation, confirming the expectation from Lauer bias.

While such a result is based on early measurements that are still affected by uncertainties currently under consideration by several observational groups, its confirmation would have a strong impact on cosmology. Here we show that-under the most conservative assumptions and independently of the baryon physics involved in galaxy formation-such galaxy abundance is not only in tension with the standard ΛCDM cosmology but provides extremely tight constraints on the expansion history of the universe and on the growth factors corresponding to a wide class of Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) models. Adopting a parameterization w = w 0 + w a (1 - a) for the evolution of the DDE equation of the state parameter w with the expansion factor a, we derive constraints on combinations of (w 0, w a ) that rule out with confidence level {\textgreater}2σ a major portion of the parameter space (w 0, w a ) allowed (or even favored) by existing cosmological probes.},

An immediate concern is the consistency of these candidates with galaxy formation in the standard ΛCDM cosmological model, wherein the stellar mass (M⋆) of a galaxy is limited by the available baryonic reservoir of its host dark matter halo. The mass function of dark matter haloes therefore imposes an absolute upper limit on the number density n ({\textgreater}M⋆, z) and stellar mass density ρ⋆ ({\textgreater}M⋆, z) of galaxies more massive than M⋆ at any epoch z.

	abstract = {In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program, which executed its early imaging component in 2022 November. The UNCOVER survey includes ultradeep (∼29–30AB) imaging of ∼45 arcmin2 on and around the well-studied A2744 galaxy cluster at z = 0.308 and will follow up ∼500 galaxies with extremely deep low-resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer of 2023, with repeat visits in summer 2024. We describe the science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the first NIRCam imaging mosaic, highlighting previously unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2–4 μm imaging of known objects in the field. The UNCOVER primary NIRCam mosaic spans 28.8 arcmin2 in seven filters (F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W) and 16.8 arcmin2 in our NIRISS parallel (F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W). To maximize early community use of the Treasury data set, we publicly release the full reduced mosaics of public JWST imaging including 45 arcmin2 NIRCam and 17 arcmin2 NIRISS mosaics on and around the A2744 cluster, including the Hubble Frontier Field primary and parallel footprints.},

	abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z ≳ 5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or an AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60\% show definitive evidence for broad-line Hα with a FWHM {\textgreater} 2000 km s ‑1, 20\% of the current data are inconclusive, and 20\% are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red z {\textgreater} 5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield {\textgreater}80\% AGN. Remarkably, among all z phot {\textgreater} 5 galaxies with F277W – F444W {\textgreater} 1 in UNCOVER at least 33\% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80\% AGN for sources with F277W – F444W {\textgreater} 1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 107–109 M ⊙. While their UV luminosities (‑16 {\textgreater} M UV {\textgreater} ‑20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 107–109 M ⊙ black holes radiating at ∼10\%–40\% the Eddington limit. The number densities are surprisingly high at ∼10‑5 Mpc‑3 mag‑1, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ∼1\% of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV faintness suggests they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe is key for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and determining their role in cosmic reionization. We perform a spectroscopic search for broad Hα emitters at z ≈ 4–6 using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys. We identify 20 Hα lines at z = 4.2–5.5 that have broad components with line widths from ∼1200–3700 km s‑1, contributing ∼30\%–90\% of the total line flux. We interpret these broad components as being powered by accretion onto SMBHs with implied masses ∼107–8 M ⊙. In the UV luminosity range M UV,AGN+host = ‑21 to ‑18, we measure number densities of ≈10‑5 cMpc‑3. This is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions (LFs). Yet, such AGN are found in only {\textless}1\% of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 5. The number density discrepancy is much lower when compared to the broad Hα LF. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects, we detect complex Hα profiles that we tentatively interpret as caused by absorption signatures from dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.},

It has been difficult to find massive galaxies at even earlier times, as the Balmer break region, which is needed for accurate mass estimates, is redshifted to wavelengths beyond 2.5 μm. Here we make use of the 1-5 μm coverage of the James Webb Space Telescope early release observations to search for intrinsically red galaxies in the first roughly 750 million years of cosmic history. In the survey area, we find six candidate massive galaxies (stellar mass more than 1010 solar masses) at 7.4 ≤ z ≤ 9.1, 500-700 Myr after the Big Bang, including one galaxy with a possible stellar mass of roughly 1011 solar masses. If verified with spectroscopy, the stellar mass density in massive galaxies would be much higher than anticipated from previous studies on the basis of rest-frame ultraviolet-selected samples.},

	abstract = {We combine fast radiative transfer calculations with high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to study an epoch of early hydrogen reionization by primordial stellar sources at redshifts 15 {\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 30. We consider the implications of various local and global feedback mechanisms using a set of models that bracket the severity of these effects to determine, qualitatively, how they may have influenced the global star formation rate and the details of hydrogen reionization. With relatively conservative assumptions, most of our models suggest that population III star formation proceeds in a self-regulated manner both locally and globally and, for a conventional ΛCDM cosmology, can significantly reionize the intergalactic medium between 15 {\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 20 as long as a large fraction of ionizing photons can escape from these earliest galaxies. We then combine these results with our earlier work focusing on the role of population II stars in galaxies with virial temperatures {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}104 K at redshifts 5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 20. Hence, we construct a complete reionization history of the Universe that matches the Thomson optical depths as measured by the WMAP satellite as well as the evolution of the Gunn-Peterson optical depth as seen in the absorption spectra of the highest redshift quasars. We find that even with conservative estimates for the impact of negative feedback mechanisms, primordial stellar sources contribute significantly to early reionization. Future observations of a Thomson optical depth of τe{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.13 would bolster the claim for the existence of population III stars similar to the ones studied here.},

They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M\_• and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon {\textasciitilde} L{\textasciicircum}0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95\% confidence level an MDO of mass M\_• {\textasciitilde} 0.006M\_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M\_• = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M\_•. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f {\textasciitilde}= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M\_•/M\_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation {\textasciitilde}0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M\_• is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M\_bulge.},

In particular, we discuss the initial conditions for Population III star formation, as given by variants of the cold dark matter cosmology. Numerical simulations have investigated the collapse and the fragmentation of metal-free gas, showing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. The exact determination of the stellar masses, and the precise form of the primordial initial mass function, is still hampered by our limited understanding of the accretion physics and the protostellar feedback effects. We address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars to the familiar mode dominated by low-mass stars at later times. We show how complementary observations, both at high redshifts and in our local cosmic neighborhood, can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract The discovery of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) in 1996, together with recent cosmological surveys from the mid-infrared to the millimeter, have revolutionized our view of star formation at high redshifts. It has become clear, in the last decade, that a population of galaxies that radiate most of their power in the far-infrared (the so-called infrared galaxies) contributes an important part of the whole galaxy build-up in the Universe. Since 1996, detailed (and often painful) investigations of the high-redshift infrared galaxies have resulted in the spectacular progress covered in this review. We outline the nature of the sources of the CIB, including their star-formation rate, stellar and total mass, morphology, metallicity, and clustering properties. We discuss their contribution to the stellar content of the Universe and their origin in the framework of the hierarchical growth of structures. We finally discuss open questions for a scenario of their evolution up to the present-day galaxies.},

Modern large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the first galaxies.},

Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z∼50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z∼200 to 6.},

Most of the baryons today are still in the form of ionized gas, which contributes a mean density uncertain by a factor of about 4. Stars and their remnants are a relatively minor component, comprising for our best-guess plasma density only about 17\% of the baryons, while populations contributing most of the blue starlight comprise less than 5\%. The formation of galaxies and of stars within them appears to be a globally inefficient process. The sum over our budget, expressed as a fraction of the critical Einstein-de Sitter density, is in the range 0.007 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} ΩB {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.041, with a best guess of ΩB {\textasciitilde} 0.021 (at Hubble constant 70 km s-1 Mpc-1). The central value agrees with the prediction from the theory of light element production and with measures of the density of intergalactic plasma at redshift z {\textasciitilde} 3.

	abstract = {In the framework of the ESO Large Programme ``First Stars'', very high-quality spectra of some 70 very metal-poor dwarfs and giants were obtained with the ESO VLT and UVES spectrograph. These stars are likely to have descended from the first generation(s) of stars formed after the Big Bang, and their detailed composition provides constraints on issues such as the nature of the first supernovae, the efficiency of mixing processes in the early Galaxy, the formation and evolution of the halo of the Galaxy, and the possible sources of reionization of the Universe. This paper presents the abundance analysis of an homogeneous sample of 35 giants selected from the HK survey of Beers et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{BPS92\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{Be99\}), emphasizing stars of extremely low metallicity: 30 of our 35 stars are in the range -4.1 {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless} -2.7, and 22 stars have [Fe/H] {\textless} -3.0. Our new VLT/UVES spectra, at a resolving power of R∼45 000 and with signal-to-noise ratios of 100-200 per pixel over the wavelength range 330-1000 nm, are greatly superior to those of the classic studies of McWilliam et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{MPS95\}) and Ryan et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{RNB96\}). The immediate objective of the work is to determine precise, comprehensive, and homogeneous element abundances for this large sample of the most metal-poor giants presently known. In the analysis we combine the spectral line modeling code ``Turbospectrum'' with OSMARCS model atmospheres, which treat continuum scattering correctly and thus allow proper interpretation of the blue regions of the spectra, where scattering becomes important relative to continuous absorption (λ {\textless} 400 nm). We obtain detailed information on the trends of elemental abundance ratios and the star-to-star scatter around those trends, enabling us to separate the relative contributions of cosmic scatter and observational/analysis errors. Abundances of 17 elements from C to Zn have been measured in all stars, including K and Zn, which have not previously been detected in stars with [Fe/H] {\textless} -3.0. Among the key results, we discuss the oxygen abundance (from the forbidden [OI] line), the different and sometimes complex trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity, the very tight relationship between the abundances of certain elements (e.g., Fe and Cr), and the high [Zn/Fe] ratio in the most metal-poor stars. Within the error bars, the trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity are consistent with those found in earlier literature, but in many cases the scatter around the average trends is much smaller than found in earlier studies, which were limited to lower-quality spectra. We find that the cosmic scatter in several element ratios may be as low as 0.05 dex. The evolution of the abundance trends and scatter with declining metallicity provides strong constraints on the yields of the first supernovae and their mixing into the early ISM. The abundance ratios found in our sample do not match the predicted yields from pair-instability hypernovae, but are consistent with element production by supernovae with progenitor masses up to 100 M⊙.

	abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large (6.6 m), cold ({\textless}50 K), infrared (IR)-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the next decade into orbit around the second Earth Sun Lagrange point. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-IR camera, a near-IR multiobject spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover the wavelength range, 0.6 {\textless} ; {\textless} 5.0 μ m, while the mid-IR instrument will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 {\textless} ; {\textless} 29 μ m. The JWST science goals are divided into four themes. The key objective of The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization theme is to identify the first luminous sources to form and to determine the ionization history of the early universe. The key objective of The Assembly of Galaxies theme is to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The key objective of The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme is to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The key objective of the Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme is to determine the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. Within these themes and objectives, we have derived representative astronomical observations. To enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package, a spacecraft, and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments, some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The instrument package contains the four science instruments and a fine guidance sensor. The spacecraft provides pointing, orbit maintenance, and communications. The sunshield provides passive thermal control. The JWST operations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and the majority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international astronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.},

We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties, and impact of Pop III stars and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following: ■Primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function.■Feedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact.■In extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 105Mȯ. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars.■Direct observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging. Indirect constraints from the global 21-cm signal or gravitational waves are more promising.■Stellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.},

	abstract = {This White Paper, submitted to the recent ESA call for science themes to define its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformational leap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) How does ordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2) How do black holes grow and shape the Universe? Hot gas in clusters, groups and the intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe. To understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and assembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical properties and evolution. This requires spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy with a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolving power compared to currently planned facilities. Feedback from supermassive black holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxy evolution models, but it is not well understood. X-ray observations can uniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes and determine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. Due to the effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requires knowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmic time, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. X-ray emission is the most reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed must improve by a factor {\textasciitilde}100 over current facilities to perform a full census into the early Universe. The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (Athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution, spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the Hot and Energetic Universe. These capabilities will also provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.},

	abstract = {To constrain the nature of the very first stars, we investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial, metal-free gas clouds. We explore the physics of primordial star formation by means of three-dimensional simulations of the dark matter and gas components, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, under a wide range of initial conditions, including the initial spin, the total mass of the halo, the redshift of virialization, the power spectrum of the DM fluctuations, the presence of HD cooling, and the number of particles employed in the simulation. We find characteristic values for the temperature, T{\textasciitilde}a few 100 K, and the density, n{\textasciitilde}103-104 cm-3, characterizing the gas at the end of the initial free-fall phase. These values are rather insensitive to the initial conditions. The corresponding Jeans mass is MJ{\textasciitilde}103 Msolar. The existence of these characteristic values has a robust explanation in the microphysics of H2 cooling, connected to the minimum temperature that can be reached with the H2 coolant, and to the critical density at which the transition takes place between levels being populated according to non-LTE (NLTE), and according to LTE. In all cases, the gas dissipatively settles into an irregular, central configuration that has a filamentary and knotty appearance. The fluid regions with the highest densities are the first to undergo runaway collapse due to gravitational instability, and to form clumps with initial masses {\textasciitilde}103 Msolar, close to the characteristic Jeans scale. These results suggest that the first stars might have been quite massive, possibly even very massive with M*{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}100 Msolar. After a gas element has undergone runaway collapse, and has reached densities in excess of 108 cm-3, a sink particle is created. This procedure allows us to follow the evolution of the overall system beyond the point where the first nonlinear region would otherwise force the calculation to a halt. These later evolutionary stages, during which the clumps grow in mass due to accretion and merging with other clumps, are quite sensitive to the initial conditions. The key process in building up very massive clumps, with masses up to a few times 104 Msolar, is merging between clumps. Since the merging rate sensitively depends on the density of the gas, halos with the highest degree of central concentration are able to assemble the most massive clumps. Among these are halos with a low spin (λ{\textasciitilde}=0.01), and with DM fluctuations imprinted according to a white-noise spectrum.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive ({\textasciitilde}100-300 Msolar). Could these stars have left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range MHe=64-133 Msolar, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of approximately 140-260 Msolar. Above MHe=133 Msolar, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter helium core masses, {\textasciitilde}40-63 Msolar, violent pulsations occur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140 Msolar (MHe=9-63 Msolar) as well as those above 260 Msolar. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 Msolar of 56Ni is produced, making these the most energetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge (Si, S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclear charge-Na, Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack of s- and r-processes. The Fe/Si ratio is quite sensitive to whether the upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 Msolar or somewhere between 140 and 260 Msolar. When the yields of pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of the nucleosynthesis of Population III stars from 12 to 40 Msolar, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of odd-Z elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our predictions are discussed.},

At the same time, it posed one of the most profound mysteries in all of science, with deep connections to both astrophysics and particle physics. Cosmic acceleration could arise from the repulsive gravity of dark energy—for example, the quantum energy of the vacuum—or it may signal that general relativity (GR) breaks down on cosmological scales and must be replaced. We review the present observational evidence for cosmic acceleration and what it has revealed about dark energy, discuss the various theoretical ideas that have been proposed to explain acceleration, and describe the key observational probes that will shed light on this enigma in the coming years.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter ΛCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (θ*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the ΛCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter ΛCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Ω b h 2, Ω c h 2, and ΩΛ, are each determined to a precision of {\textasciitilde}1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5σ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their ΛCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r {\textless} 0.13 (95\% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to {\textbackslash}Omega \_k = -0.0027{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{- 0.0038\}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m ν {\textless} 0.44 eV (95\% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

	abstract = {WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Λ-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters are h=0.72+/-0.05, Ωbh2=0.024+/-0.001, Ωmh2=0.14+/-0.02, τ=0.166+0.076-0.071, ns=0.99+/-0.04, and σ8=0.9+/-0.1. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyα forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Lyα forest data to find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Ωbh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, Ωmh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, τ=0.17+/-0.06, ns(0.05 Mpc-1)=0.93+/-0.03, and σ8=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination of τ=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. With the Lyα forest data, the model favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Lyα forest. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Ωtot=1.02+/-0.02, and the equation of state of the dark energy, w{\textless}-0.78 (95\% confidence limit assuming w{\textgreater}=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy density in stable neutrinos: Ωνh2{\textless}0.0072 (95\% confidence limit). For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95\% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero-baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ωb/Ω0 {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} Ω0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter Γ.},

	abstract = {We analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal at 105 h-1 Mpc. The 6dFGS BAO detection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at zeff= 0.106. We achieve a distance measure of DV(zeff) = 457 ± 27 Mpc and a measurement of the distance ratio, rs(zd)/DV(zeff) = 0.336 ± 0.015 (4.5 per cent precision), where rs(zd) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch zd. The low-effective redshift of 6dFGS makes it a competitive and independent alternative to Cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the Hubble constant. We find a Hubble constant of H0= 67 ± 3.2 km s-1 Mpc-1 (4.8 per cent precision) that depends only on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe-7 (WMAP-7) calibration of the sound horizon and on the galaxy clustering in 6dFGS. Compared to earlier BAO studies at higher redshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to H0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state parameter w and H0 in the cosmic microwave background data. We determine that w=-0.97 ± 0.13, using only WMAP-7 and BAO data from both 6dFGS and Percival et al. (2010). We also discuss predictions for the large-scale correlation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the Wide field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) blind H I survey (with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN) all-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope. We find that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the BAO peak, making WALLABY the first radio galaxy survey to do so. We also predict that TAIPAN has the potential to constrain the Hubble constant with 3 per cent precision.},

The survey region covers 0.72 h-3 Gpc3 over 3816 deg2 and 0.16-1 Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z{\textasciitilde}1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4\% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5\% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Ωmh2 to 8\% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Ωm=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w0)+0.137ΩK. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is ΩK=-0.010+/-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

These include the complete sample of all suitable SNe Ia discovered in the last four decades at redshift z ≤ 0.01, collected and calibrated from ≥1000 HST orbits, more than doubling the sample whose size limits the precision of the direct determination of H 0. The Cepheids are calibrated geometrically from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, masers in NGC 4258 (here tripling that sample of Cepheids), and detached eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud. All Cepheids in these anchors and SN Ia hosts were measured with the same instrument (WFC3) and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) to negate zero-point errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and six tests of background determinations that show Cepheid measurements are accurate in the presence of crowded backgrounds. The SNe Ia in these hosts calibrate the magnitude-redshift relation from the revised Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SN data and with host properties and SN surveys matched throughout to negate systematics. We decrease the uncertainty in the local determination of H 0 to 1 km s-1 Mpc-1 including systematics. We present results for a comprehensive set of nearly 70 analysis variants to explore the sensitivity of H 0 to selections of anchors, SN surveys, redshift ranges, the treatment of Cepheid dust, metallicity, form of the period-luminosity relation, SN color, peculiar-velocity corrections, sample bifurcations, and simultaneous measurement of the expansion history. Our baseline result from the Cepheid-SN Ia sample is H 0 = 73.04 ± 1.04 km s-1 Mpc-1, which includes systematic uncertainties and lies near the median of all analysis variants. We demonstrate consistency with measures from HST of the TRGB between SN Ia hosts and NGC 4258, and include them simultaneously to yield 72.53 ± 0.99 km s-1 Mpc-1. The inclusion of high-redshift SNe Ia yields H 0 = 73.30 ± 1.04 km s-1 Mpc-1 and q 0 = -0.51 ± 0.024. We find a 5σ difference with the prediction of H 0 from Planck cosmic microwave background observations under ΛCDM, with no indication that the discrepancy arises from measurement uncertainties or analysis variations considered to date. The source of this now long-standing discrepancy between direct and cosmological routes to determining H 0 remains unknown.},

	abstract = {The cosmological principle is fundamental to the standard cosmological model. It assumes that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on very large scales. As the basic assumption, it must stand the test of various observations. In this work, we investigated the properties of the Pantheon+ sample, including redshift distribution and position distribution, and we give its constraint on the flat ΛCDM model: Ωm = 0.36 ± 0.02 and H0 = 72.83 ± 0.23 km s−1 Mpc−1. Then, using the region fitting (RF) method, we mapped the all-sky distribution of cosmological parameters (Ωm and H0) and find that the distribution significantly deviates from isotropy. A local matter underdensity region exists toward (308.4°−48.7+47.6, −18.2°−28.8+21.1) as well as a preferred direction of the cosmic anisotropy (313.4°−18.2+19.6, −16.8°−10.7+11.1) in galactic coordinates. Similar directions may imply that local matter density might be responsible for the anisotropy of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Results of statistical isotropy analyses including Isotropy and Isotropy with real-data positions (RP) show high confidence levels. For the local matter underdensity, the statistical significances are 2.78σ (isotropy) and 2.34σ (isotropy RP). For the cosmic anisotropy, the statistical significances are 3.96σ (isotropy) and 3.15σ (isotropy RP). The comparison of these two kinds of statistical isotropy analyses suggests that inhomogeneous spatial distribution of real sample can increase the deviation from isotropy. The similar results and findings are also found from reanalyses of the low-redshift sample (lp+) and the lower screening angle (θmax = 60°), but with a slight decrease in statistical significance. Overall, our results provide clear indications for a possible cosmic anisotropy. This possibility must be taken seriously. Further testing is needed to better understand this signal.},

This is a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, underpinning the use of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric as part of the concordance ΛCDM paradigm. However, the observed dipole imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is interpreted as our departure from the Hubble flow, and such a proper motion will induce a directionally-dependent time dilation over the sky. We illustrate the feasibility of detection of this 'time dilation dipole' and sketch the practical steps involved in its extraction from a catalogue of sources with intrinsic time-scales. In essence, whilst the scale of this dilation is small, being of the order of 0.1 per cent, it will in principle be detectable in large-scale surveys of variable cosmological sources, such as quasars and supernovae. The degree of alignment of the time dilation dipole with the kinematic dipole derived from the CMB will provide a new assessment of the cosmological principle and address the tension in dipole measures from other observations.},

	abstract = {The Cosmological Principle, that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, underpins the standard model of cosmology. However, a recent analysis of 1.36 million infrared-selected quasars has identified a significant tension in the amplitude of the number-count dipole compared to that derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), thus challenging the Cosmological Principle. Here, we present a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various hypotheses using the Bayesian evidence. We find unambiguous evidence for the presence of a dipole in the distribution of quasars with a direction that is consistent with the dipole identified in the CMB. However, the amplitude of the dipole is found to be 2.7 times larger than that expected from the conventional kinematic explanation of the CMB dipole, with a statistical significance of 5.7σ. To compare these results with theoretical expectations, we sharpen the ΛCDM predictions for the probability distribution of the amplitude, taking into account a number of observational and theoretical systematics. In particular, we show that the presence of the Galactic plane mask causes a considerable loss of dipole signal due to a leakage of power into higher multipoles, exacerbating the discrepancy in the amplitude. By contrast, we show using probabilistic arguments that the source evolution of quasars improves the discrepancy, but only mildly so. These results support the original findings of an anomalously large quasar dipole, independent of the statistical methodology used.},

	abstract = {The assumption that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales is one of the fundamental postulates of cosmology. We have tested the large-scale homogeneity of the galaxy distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release One (SDSS-DR1) using volume-limited subsamples extracted from the two equatorial strips that are nearly two-dimensional. The galaxy distribution was projected on the equatorial plane and we carried out a 2D multifractal analysis by counting the number of galaxies inside circles of different radii, r, in the range 5-150h-1Mpc centred on galaxies. Different moments of the count-in-cells were analysed to identify a range of length-scales (60-70h-1Mpc to 150h-1Mpc), where the moments show a power-law scaling behaviour, and to determine the scaling exponent that gives the spectrum of generalized dimension Dq. If the galaxy distribution is homogeneous, Dq does not vary with q and is equal to the Euclidean dimension, which in our case is 2. We find that Dq varies in the range 1.7-2.2. We also constructed mock data from random, homogeneous point distributions and from lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM)N-body simulations with bias b= 1, 1.6 and 2, and analysed these in exactly the same way. The values of Dq in the random distribution and the unbiased simulations show much smaller variations and these are not consistent with the actual data. The biased simulations, however, show larger variations in Dq and these are consistent with both the random and the actual data. Interpreting the actual data as a realization of a biased ΛCDM universe, we conclude that the galaxy distribution is homogeneous on scales larger than 60-70h-1Mpc.},

We have carried out a multifractal analysis of the galaxy distribution in a volume-limited subsample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6. This considers the scaling properties of different moments of galaxy number counts in spheres of varying radius, r, centred on galaxies. This analysis gives the spectrum of generalized dimension Dq(r), where q {\textgreater} 0 quantifies the scaling properties in overdense regions and q {\textless} 0 in underdense regions. We expect Dq(r) = 3 for a homogeneous, random point distribution. In our analysis, we have determined Dq(r) in the range -4 {\textless}= q {\textless}= 4 and 7 {\textless}= r {\textless}= 98h-1 Mpc. In addition to the SDSS data, we have analysed several random samples which are homogeneous by construction. Simulated galaxy samples generated from dark matter N-body simulations and the Millennium Run were also analysed. The SDSS data is considered to be homogeneous if the measured Dq is consistent with that of the random samples. We find that the galaxy distribution becomes homogeneous at a length-scale between 60 and 70h-1Mpc. The galaxy distribution, we find, is homogeneous at length-scales greater than 70h-1Mpc. This is consistent with earlier works which find the transition to homogeneity at around 70h-1Mpc.},

	abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

Using the scale-independent Multi-scale Morphology Filter algorithm, we are able to quantitatively describe the density field and disentangle it into its major components: fields, filaments, and clusters. We show that the observed median star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, specific SFR, the mean SFR-mass relation, and its scatter for both Hα emitters and underlying star-forming galaxies do not strongly depend on different classes of environment, in agreement with previous studies. However, the fraction of Hα emitters varies with environment and is enhanced in filamentary structures at z {\textasciitilde} 1. We propose mild galaxy-galaxy interactions as the possible physical agent for the elevation of the fraction of Hα star-forming galaxies in filaments. Our results show that filaments are the likely physical environments that are often classed as the "intermediate" densities and that the cosmic web likely plays a major role in galaxy formation and evolution which has so far been poorly investigated.},

	abstract = {Galaxy properties are known to be affected by their environment. This is well established for the extremes of the density scales, between the high-density cluster environment and the low-density field. It is, however, not fully understood how the intermediate-density regime of cosmic web filaments affects galaxy evolution. We investigate this environmental effect using a mass complete sample of 23 441 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR8 Main Galaxy Sample (\$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Stellar\}\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.91\} {\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$). We define six environments, probing different density regimes and representing unique stages in the structure formation process, comparing the differences in star formation activity and morphology between them. We find that galaxies in filaments tend to be less star-forming and favour more early-type morphologies than those in the field. These differences persist when considering stellar mass-matched samples, suggesting that this is a consequence of the environment. We further investigate whether these trends are a result of the large-scale or local environment through constructing samples matched both in stellar mass and local galaxy density. We find that when also matching in local galaxy density, the differences observed between the filament and field population vanishes, concluding that the environmental effect of filaments can be entirely parametrized by a local galaxy density index. We find that differences can still be seen in comparisons with the interiors of clusters, suggesting these are unique environments which can impart additional physical processes not characterized by local galaxy density.},

	abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LF) of star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) using data from the ZFOURGE survey. We employ CIGALE to decompose the spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies into SF and AGN components to investigate the co-evolution of these processes at higher redshifts and fainter luminosities. Our CIGALE-derived SF and AGN LFs are generally consistent with previous studies, with an enhancement at the faint end of the AGN LFs. We attribute this to CIGALE's capability to recover low-luminosity AGN more accurately, which may be underrepresented in other works. As anticipated, the CIGALE SF LFs are best fit with a Schechter function, whereas the AGN LFs align more closely with a Saunders function. We find evidence for a significant evolutionary epoch for AGN activity at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 1\$, comparable to the peak of cosmic star formation at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 2\$, which we also recover well. Based on our results, the gas supply in the early universe favoured the formation of brighter star-forming galaxies until \$z=2\$, below which the gas for SF becomes increasingly exhausted. Conversely, AGN activity peaked earlier and declined more slowly until \$z {\textbackslash}approx 1\$, suggesting a possible feedback scenario in which \$2.5-3\$ Gyrs offset the evolution of SF and AGN activity.},

	abstract = {On large cosmological scales, anisotropic gravitational collapse is manifest in the dark cosmic web. Its statistical properties are little known for alternative dark matter (DM) models such as fuzzy dark matter (FDM). In this work, we assess for the first time the relative importance of cosmic nodes, filaments, walls, and voids in a cosmology with primordial small-scale suppression of power. We post-process N-body simulations of FDM-like cosmologies with varying axion mass m at redshifts z {\textasciitilde} 1.0-5.6 using the NEXUS+ Multiscale Morphology Filter technique at smoothing scale Δx = 0.04 h-1 Mpc. The formation of wall and void halos is more suppressed than naively expected from the half-mode mass M1/2. Also, we quantify the mass- and volume-filling fractions of cosmic environments and find that 2D cosmic sheets host a larger share of the matter content of the Universe as m is reduced, with an {\textasciitilde}8-12 per cent increase for the m = 7 × 10-22 eV model compared to cold dark matter (CDM). We show that in FDM-like cosmologies, filaments, walls, and voids are cleaner and more pronounced structures than in CDM, revealed by a strong mid-range peak in the conditioned overdensity PDFs P(δ). At high redshift, low-density regions are more suppressed than high-density regions. Furthermore, skewness estimates S3 of the total overdensity PDF in FDM-like cosmologies are consistently higher than in CDM, especially at high redshift z {\textasciitilde} 5.6 where the m = 10-22 eV model differs from CDM by {\textasciitilde}6σ. Accordingly, we advocate for the usage of P(δ) as a testbed for constraining FDM and other alternative DM models.},

The results obtained demonstrate that the two clusters are embedded in a common supercluster of very large extent. It is found that there are three observationally distinct populations of galaxies within this supercluster, including galaxies located in the two rich cluster cores, those located in intermediate- or low-mass clusters, and a nearly homogeneously distributed population of isolated galaxies; in addition, a population of foreground galaxies located in low-mass clusters rather than being distributed in a homogeneous 'field' is also identified. The redshift of formation for the foreground groups is estimated to be no more than about 9, and the morphology of the galaxies is examined. It is suggested that every nearby very rich cluster is located in a supercluster and that all clusters of richness class greater than or equal to 2 will eventually be found to lie in superclusters.},

	abstract = {We report on the implications for cosmic inflation of the 2018 release of the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements. The results are fully consistent with those reported using the data from the two previous Planck cosmological releases, but have smaller uncertainties thanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization at low and high multipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the spectral index of scalar perturbations to be ns = 0.9649 ± 0.0042 at 68\% CL. We find no evidence for a scale dependence of ns, either as a running or as a running of the running. The Universe is found to be consistent with spatial flatness with a precision of 0.4\% at 95\% CL by combining Planck with a compilation of baryon acoustic oscillation data. The Planck 95\% CL upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r0.002 {\textless} 0.10, is further tightened by combining with the BICEP2/Keck Array BK15 data to obtain r0.002 {\textless} 0.056. In the framework of standard single-field inflationary models with Einstein gravity, these results imply that: (a) the predictions of slow-roll models with a concave potential, V″(ϕ) {\textless} 0, are increasingly favoured by the data; and (b) based on two different methods for reconstructing the inflaton potential, we find no evidence for dynamics beyond slow roll. Three different methods for the non-parametric reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum consistently confirm a pure power law in the range of comoving scales 0.005 Mpc-1 ≲ k ≲ 0.2 Mpc-1. A complementary analysis also finds no evidence for theoretically motivated parameterized features in the Planck power spectra. For the case of oscillatory features that are logarithmic or linear in k, this result is further strengthened by a new combined analysis including the Planck bispectrum data. The new Planck polarization data provide a stringent test of the adiabaticity of the initial conditions for the cosmological fluctuations. In correlated, mixed adiabatic and isocurvature models, the non-adiabatic contribution to the observed CMB temperature variance is constrained to 1.3\%, 1.7\%, and 1.7\% at 95\% CL for cold dark matter, neutrino density, and neutrino velocity, respectively. Planck power spectra plus lensing set constraints on the amplitude of compensated cold dark matter-baryon isocurvature perturbations that are consistent with current complementary measurements. The polarization data also provide improved constraints on inflationary models that predict a small statistically anisotropic quadupolar modulation of the primordial fluctuations. However, the polarization data do not support physical models for a scale-dependent dipolar modulation. All these findings support the key predictions of the standard single-field inflationary models, which will be further tested by future cosmological observations.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5σ level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density Ωch2 = 0.120 ± 0.001, baryon density Ωbh2 = 0.0224 ± 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 ± 0.004, and optical depth τ = 0.054 ± 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100θ* = 1.0411 ± 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 ± 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.811 ± 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-ΛCDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 ± 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to ∑mν {\textless} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base ΛCDM at over 2σ, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the ΛCDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, ΩK = 0.001 ± 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 ± 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {\textless} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-ΛCDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6σ, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter Ωm = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of τ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z\_re=8.8+1.7-1.4. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ mν {\textless} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbar} ΩK {\textbar} {\textless} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002{\textless} 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 {\textless} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(φ) ∝ φ2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

A violation of this postulate implies the possibility that the apparent cosmic acceleration could be explained without the need of a cosmological constant, dark energy or covariant modifications of gravity. In this paper we present a new test of the C P relating the distance and the expansion rate, derived via Noether's theorem, which is complementary to other tests found in the literature. We also simulate fiducial data based on upcoming stage IV galaxy surveys and use them to reconstruct the Hubble rate H (z ) and the angular diameter distance dA(z ) in order to forecast how well our null test can constrain deviations from the cosmological constant model. We find that our new test can easily rule out several scenarios based on the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi void model at confidence of ≳3 σ at middle to high redshifts (z {\textgreater}0.5 ) .},

This structure of galaxies consists of rich and poor clusters, connected by filaments and sheets, with regions largely devoid of galaxies (voids) in between1. Numerical simulations of the growth of initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of filaments and voids2,3,18, but the origin of this picture of filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we show that the 'web' of filaments that defines the final state in these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations; the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the structure bringing the filamentary network into sharper relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution, we suggest that 'superclusters' are filamentary cluster-cluster bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned with each other and close together.},

Following theoretical predictions derived from hydrodynamical simulations, we model the dusty torus as a 3D two-phase medium with high-density clumps and low-density medium filling the space between the clumps. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images of the torus at different wavelengths are obtained using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. Our approach of generating clumpy structure allows us to model the tori with single clumps, complex structures of merged clumps or interconnected sponge-like structure. A corresponding set of clumps-only models and models with smooth dust distribution is calculated for comparison. We found that dust distribution, optical depth, clump size and their actual arrangement in the innermost region all have an impact on the shape of near- and mid-infrared SED. The 10-μm silicate feature can be suppressed for some parameters, but models with smooth dust distribution are also able to produce a wide range of silicate feature strength. Finally, we find that having the dust distributed in a two-phase medium might offer a natural solution to the lack of emission in near-infrared, compared to observed data, which affects clumpy models currently available in the literature.},

For a strategic survey of such galaxies and the interpretation of the obtained data, this paper presents an ultraviolet-to-optical spectral model of galaxies with a great care of the nebular emission. In particular, we present a machine-readable table of intensities of 119 nebular emission lines from Lyα to the rest-frame 1 ?m as a function of metallicity from zero to the solar one. Based on the spectral model, we present criteria of equivalent widths of Lyα, He IIλ1640, Hα, Hβ and [O III]λ5007 to select extremely metal-poor and metal-free galaxies although these criteria have uncertainty caused by the Lyman continuum escape fraction and the star formation duration. We also present criteria of broad-band colours which will be useful to select candidates for spectroscopic follow-up from drop-out galaxies. We propose the line intensity ratio of [O III]λ5007 to Hβ \&lt; 0.1 as the most robust criterion for \&lt;1/1000 of the solar metallicity.

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and 2 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} yr at a resolution of 3 Å across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 Å for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m\&gt;{\textasciitilde}1 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.08 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and a variance in logarithmic mass σ{\textasciitilde}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and σ{\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BD{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.1 pc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages \&gt;{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfvénic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

	abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 μm of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\textasciitilde}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\textasciitilde}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\textasciitilde}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is {\textasciitilde}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

	abstract = {The primary source of emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the accretion disc, is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick dusty structure (`the so-called dusty torus'). The infrared radiation emitted by the dust is nothing but a reprocessed fraction of the accretion disc emission, so the ratio of the torus to the AGN luminosity (Ltorus/LAGN) should corresponds to the fraction of the sky obscured by dust, I.e. the covering factor. We undertook a critical investigation of the Ltorus/LAGN as the dust covering factor proxy. Using state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we calculated a grid of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) emitted by the clumpy two-phase dusty structure. With this grid of SEDs, we studied the relation between Ltorus/LAGN and the dust covering factor for different parameters of the torus. We found that in the case of type 1 AGNs the torus anisotropy makes Ltorus/LAGN underestimate low covering factors and overestimate high covering factors. In type 2 AGNs Ltorus/LAGN always underestimates covering factors. Our results provide a novel easy-to-use method to account for anisotropy and obtain correct covering factors. Using two samples from the literature, we demonstrated the importance of our result for inferring the obscured AGN fraction. We found that after the anisotropy is properly accounted for, the dust covering factors show very weak dependence on LAGN, with values in the range of ≈0.6-0.7. Our results also suggest a higher fraction of obscured AGNs at high luminosities than those found by X-ray surveys, in part owing to the presence of a Compton-thick AGN population predicted by population synthesis models.},

	abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of {\textasciitilde}1 kpc. We have obtained a {\textasciitilde}29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z {\textgreater} 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M sun yr-1, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of {\textasciitilde}2 × 1011 M sun. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [N II]/Hα, [S II]/Hα, and [O II]/[O III] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is {\textless}1\% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes lsim8\% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up lsim10\% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to {\textasciitilde}40\% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

We review potential wind-driving mechanisms and observed wind properties, with a focus on the warm ionized and hot X-ray-emitting gas. Energy and momentum injection by supernovae (SNe), cosmic rays, radiation pressure, and magnetic fields are considered in the light of observations: ▪ Emission and absorption line measurements of cool/warm gas provide our best physical diagnostics of galactic outflows. ▪ The critical unsolved problem is how to accelerate cool gas to the high velocities observed. Although conclusive evidence for no one mechanism exists, the momentum, energy, and mass-loading budgets observed compare well with theory. ▪ A model in which star formation provides a force ∼L/c, where L is the bolometric luminosity, and cool gas is pushed out of the galaxy\&apos;s gravitational potential, compares well with available data. The wind power is ∼0.1 of that provided by SNe. ▪ The very hot X-ray-emitting phase may be a (or the) prime mover. Momentum and energy exchange between the hot and cooler phases is critical to the gas dynamics. ▪ Gaps in our observational knowledge include the hot gas kinematics and the size and structure of the outflows probed with UV absorption lines. Simulations are needed to more fully understand mixing, cloud–radiation, cloud–cosmic ray, andcloud–hot wind interactions, the collective effects of star clusters, and both distributed andclustered SNe.

High-resolution radio imaging and multiwavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which this happens. Evidence is presented that: ▪ Relativistic AGN jets are formed when the black hole spins and the the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of gas accreting at high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence. ▪ AGN jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with a disk wind. ▪ Higher-power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a relativistic, supersonic, and proton-dominated state, and they terminate in strong, hot spot shocks; lower-power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and bubbles. ▪ Jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies, which contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum and may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently radiate synchrotron γ-rays. ▪ Jets were far more common when the Universe was a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing rapidly. ▪ Jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and limiting the growth of galaxies.

On large scales, the Universe displays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on scales of ∼ 1-3 h - 1 Mpc, which lie at the intersections of long filaments of galaxies that are {\textgreater} 10 h - 1 Mpc in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space, known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between these structures. This observed large-scale structure depends both on cosmological parameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Using the two-point correlation function, one can trace the dependence of large-scale structure on galaxy properties, such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track its evolution with redshift. Comparison of the observed galaxy clustering signatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand the clustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent dark matter halos. Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter halo mass of a given galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations at different epochs, and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution models. This chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-point correlation function in both redshift and real space, presents the current results of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties, and discusses quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and filaments. The interpretation of these results with current theoretical models is also presented.},

	abstract = {In order to reproduce the high-mass end of the galaxy mass distribution, some process must be responsible for the suppression of star formation in the most massive of galaxies. Commonly active galactic nuclei (AGN) are invoked to fulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic of much debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression and enhancement of star formation in AGN hosts. Using the ZFOURGE (FourStar Galaxy Evolution) and NMBS (Newfirm Medium Band Survey) galaxy surveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited (M ≥ 1010.5 M⊙), high-luminosity (L1.4 {\textgreater} 1024 W Hz-1) sample of radio-loud AGN to a redshift of z = 2.25. In contrast to low-redshift studies, which associate radio-AGN activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z {\textgreater} 1.5 radio-AGN are hosted by star-forming galaxies. Indeed, the stellar populations of radio-AGN are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy population. Interestingly, we find that the radio-AGN fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 ≤ z {\textless} 2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-AGN duty cycle has little dependence on redshift or galaxy type. We do however see a strong relation between the radio-AGN fraction and stellar mass, with radio-AGN becoming rare below ∼1010.5 M⊙ or a halo mass of 1012 M⊙. This halo-mass threshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-AGN feedback at this mass limit. Despite this, we find that radio-AGN host star formation rates are consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy sample, suggesting that while radio-AGN are in the right place to suppress star formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible for doing so.},

A total of 288 possible counterparts were observed at the VLT with the FORS1/FORS2 spectrographs for 251 of the 349 Chandra sources (including three additional faint X-ray sources). Spectra and R-band images are shown for all the observed sources and R-K colors are given for most of them. Spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 168 X-ray sources, of which 137 have both reliable optical identification and redshift estimate (including 16 external identifications). The R{\textless}24 observed sample comprises 161 X-ray objects (181 optical counterparts), and 126 of them have unambiguous spectroscopic identification. There are two spikes in the redshift distribution, predominantly populated by type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) but also type 1 AGN and X-ray normal galaxies: the one at z=0.734 is fairly narrow (in redshift space) and comprises two clusters/groups of galaxies centered on extended X-ray sources, the second one at z=0.674 is broader and should trace a sheetlike structure. The type 1 and type 2 populations are clearly separated in X-ray/optical diagnostics involving parameters sensitive to absorption/reddening: X-ray hardness ratio (HR), optical/near-IR color, soft X-ray flux, and optical brightness. Nevertheless, these two populations cover similar ranges of hard X-ray luminosity and absolute K magnitude, thus trace similar levels of gravitational accretion. Consequently, we introduce a new classification based solely on X-ray properties, HR, and X-ray luminosity, consistent with the unified AGN model. This X-ray classification uncovers a large fraction of optically obscured, X-ray-luminous AGNs missed by the classical optical classification. We find a similar number of X-ray type 1 and type 2 QSOs [LX(0.5-10keV){\textgreater}1044 ergs s-1] at z{\textgreater}2 (13 sources with unambiguous spectroscopic identification); most X-ray type 1 QSOs are bright, R{\textless}{\textasciitilde}24, whereas most X-ray type 2 QSOs have R{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}24, which may explain the difference with the CDFN results as few spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for R{\textgreater}24 CDFN X-ray counterparts. There are X-ray type 1 QSOs down to z{\textasciitilde}0.5, but a strong decrease at z{\textless}2 in the fraction of luminous X-ray type 2 QSOs may indicate a cosmic evolution of the X-ray luminosity function of the type 2 population. An X-ray spectral analysis is required to confirm this possible evolution. The red color of most X-ray type 2 AGNs could be due to dust associated with the X-ray absorbing material and/or a substantial contribution of the host galaxy light. The latter can also be important for some redder X-ray type 1 AGNs. There is a large population of EROs (R-K{\textgreater}5) as X-ray counterparts, and their fraction strongly increases with decreasing optical flux, up to 25\% for the R{\textgreater}=24 sample. They cover the whole range of X-ray hardness ratios, comprise objects of various classes (in particular a high fraction of z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 X-ray absorbed AGNs, but also elliptical and starburst galaxies) and more than half of them should be fairly bright X-ray sources [LX(0.5-10keV){\textgreater}1042 ergs s-1]. Photometric redshifts will be necessary to derive the properties and evolution of the X-ray selected EROs.

	abstract = {Selection of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared facilitates the discovery of AGNs whose optical emission is extinguished by dust. In this paper, we use the Spitzer Space Telescope First Look Survey (FLS) to assess the fraction of AGNs with mid-infrared (MIR) luminosities that are comparable to quasars and that are missed in optical quasar surveys because of dust obscuration. We begin by using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database to identify 54 quasars within the 4 deg2 extragalactic FLS. These quasars occupy a distinct region in MIR color space by virtue of their strong, red continua. This has allowed us to define an MIR color criterion for selecting AGN candidates. About 2000 FLS objects have colors that are consistent with them being AGNs, but most are much fainter in the MIR than the SDSS quasars, which typically have 8 μm flux densities S8.0{\textasciitilde}1 mJy. We have investigated the properties of 43 objects with S8.0{\textgreater}=1 mJy that satisfy our AGN color selection. This sample should contain both unobscured quasars as well as AGNs that are absent from the SDSS survey because of extinction in the optical. After removing 16 known quasars, three probable normal quasars, and eight spurious or confused objects from the initial sample of 43, we are left with 16 objects that are likely to be obscured quasars or luminous Seyfert 2 galaxies. This suggests that the numbers of obscured and unobscured AGNs are similar in samples selected in the MIR at S8.0{\textasciitilde}1 mJy.},

	abstract = {We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the Galactic center source associated with a supermassive black hole. These observations were conducted in 2017 using a global interferometric array of eight telescopes operating at a wavelength of λ = 1.3 mm. The EHT data resolve a compact emission region with intrahour variability. A variety of imaging and modeling analyses all support an image that is dominated by a bright, thick ring with a diameter of 51.8 ± 2.3 μas (68\% credible interval). The ring has modest azimuthal brightness asymmetry and a comparatively dim interior. Using a large suite of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the EHT images of Sgr A* are consistent with the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole with mass {\textasciitilde}4 × 106 M ⊙, which is inferred to exist at this location based on previous infrared observations of individual stellar orbits, as well as maser proper-motion studies. Our model comparisons disfavor scenarios where the black hole is viewed at high inclination (i {\textgreater} 50°), as well as nonspinning black holes and those with retrograde accretion disks. Our results provide direct evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and for the first time we connect the predictions from dynamical measurements of stellar orbits on scales of 103-105 gravitational radii to event-horizon-scale images and variability. Furthermore, a comparison with the EHT results for the supermassive black hole M87* shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity spanning over three orders of magnitude in central mass.},

We confirm six star clusters (of intermediate-to-old age) to be associated with NGC 247. The vast bulk of its GC system remains to be studied spectroscopically. We also confirm the GC candidates in F8D1 and DDO190, finding both to be young star clusters. The three M31 halo GCs all have radial velocities consistent with M31 and are old and very metal-poor. Their ages and metallicities are consistent with accretion from a low-mass satellite galaxy. Finally, three objects are found to be background galaxies – two are projected near NGC 247 and one (candidate GCC7) is near the IKN dwarf. The IKN dwarf thus has only five confirmed GCs but still a remarkable specific frequency of 124.},

	abstract = {We investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function of galaxies in hierarchical clustering models. Beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos in the ΛCDM (Λ cold dark matter) cosmology, we show, in incremental steps, how gas cooling, photoionization at high redshift, feedback processes, galaxy merging, and thermal conduction affect the shape of the luminosity function. We consider three processes whereby supernovae and stellar wind energy can affect the forming galaxy: (1) the reheating of cold disk gas to the halo temperature; (2) expansion of the hot, diffuse halo gas; and (3) complete expulsion of cold disk gas from the halo. We demonstrate that while feedback of form 1 is able to flatten the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function, this process alone does not produce the sharp cutoff observed at large luminosities. Feedback of form 2 is also unable to solve the problem at the bright end of the luminosity function. The relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling in massive halos is strongly suppressed. This might happen if thermal conduction near the centers of halos is very efficient, or if a substantial amount of gas is expelled from halos by process 3 above. Conduction is a promising mechanism, but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the desired level. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright galaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernova explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of central supermassive black holes and the associated energy generation play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars that form in the host galaxy. The models that best reproduce the galaxy luminosity function also give reasonable approximations to the Tully-Fisher relation and the galaxy autocorrelation function.},

The former corresponds to emission from dust heated by stars and AGN, whereas the latter includes emission from AGN-heated dust only. We find that at all redshifts (at least up to z {\textasciitilde} 2.5), the high-luminosity tails of the two LFs converge, indicating that the most IR-luminous galaxies are AGN-powered. Our results shed light to the decades-old conundrum regarding the flatter high-luminosity slope seen in the IR galaxy LF compared to that in the UV and optical. We attribute this difference to the increasing fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies with increasing total IR luminosity (LIR). We partition the LIR-z parameter space into a star formation-dominated and an AGN-dominated region, finding that the most luminous galaxies at all epochs lie in the AGN-dominated region. This sets a potential 'limit' to attainable star formation rates, casting doubt on the abundance of 'extreme starbursts': if AGN did not exist, LIR {\textgreater} 1013 L⊙ galaxies would be significantly rarer than they currently are in our observable Universe. We also find that AGN affect the average dust temperatures (Tdust) of galaxies and hence the shape of the well-known LIR-Tdust relation. We propose that the reason why local ULIRGs are hotter than their high-redshift counterparts is because of a higher fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies amongst the former group.},

Recent years have seen remarkable advances in our understanding of how these BHs form and grow over cosmic time, during which they are revealed as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, despite decades of research, we still lack a coherent picture of the physical drivers of BH growth, the connection between the growth of BHs and their host galaxies, the role of large-scale environment on the fueling of BHs, and the impact of BH-driven outflows on the growth of galaxies. In this paper we review our progress in addressing these key issues, motivated by the science presented at the "What drives the growth of black holes?" workshop held at Durham on 26-29th July 2010, and discuss how these questions may be tackled with current and future facilities.},

Methods: The A3COSMOS survey utilizes all publicly available ALMA data in the COSMOS field and therefore has inhomogeneous coverage in terms of observing wavelength and depth. In order to derive the luminosity functions and star formation rate densities, we applied a newly developed method that corrects the statistics of an inhomogeneously sampled survey of individual pointings to those representing an unbiased blind survey. Results: We find our sample to mostly consist of massive (M⋆ ∼ 1010 − 1012 M⊙) IR-bright (L* ∼ 1011 − 1013.5 L⊙) highly star-forming (SFR ∼100 − 1000 M⊙ yr−1) galaxies. We find an evolutionary trend in the typical density (Φ*) and luminosity (L*) of the galaxy population that respectively decreases and increases with redshift. Our infrared luminosity function (LF) is in agreement with previous literature results, and we were able to extend the constraints on the knee and bright end of the LF to high redshift (z {\textgreater} 3) by using the Herschel data. Finally, we obtained the star formation rate density up to z ∼ 6 by integrating the IR LF, finding a broad peak from z ∼ 1 to z ∼ 3 and a decline toward higher redshifts, in agreement with recent IR/millimeter-based studies, within the uncertainties. These results imply the presence of larger quantities of dust than what is expected based on optical/UV studies.},

Starting from the rich multiwavelength photometric data sets available in both fields, we perform a broad-band spectral energy distribution decomposition to disentangle the possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) contribution from that related to the host galaxy. We find that 37 per cent of the Herschel-selected sample shows signatures of nuclear activity at the 99 per cent confidence level. The probability of revealing AGN activity increases for bright (L1-1000 {\textgreater} 1011 L⊙) star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 0.3, becoming about 80 per cent for the brightest (L1-1000 {\textgreater} 1012 L⊙) infrared (IR) galaxies at z ≥ 1. Finally, we reconstruct the AGN bolometric luminosity function and the supermassive black hole growth rate across cosmic time up to z ∼ 3 from a far-IR perspective. This work shows general agreement with most of the panchromatic estimates from the literature, with the global black hole growth peaking at z ∼ 2 and reproducing the observed local black hole mass density with consistent values of the radiative efficiency ɛrad (∼0.07).},

It also has the ability to model active galactic nucleus (AGN) through the inclusion of a simple AGN and hot torus model. Finally, it makes use of MAPPINGS-III photoionization tables to produce line emission features. We test the generative and inversion utility of ProSpect through application to the Shark galaxy formation semi-analytic code, and informed by these results produce fits to the final ultraviolet to far-infrared photometric catalogues produces by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Survey.

Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector- α, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts Hα luminosities with a scatter of ∼0.18 dex and an offset of ∼0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the Hα luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and Hδ. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects.

We combine a parametric description of the star formation history with a closed-box evolution of metallicity where the present-day gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy is a free parameter. We show with this approach that we are able to recover the observationally determined cosmic star formation history (CSFH), an indication that stars are being formed in the correct epoch of the Universe, on average, for the manner in which we are conducting SED fitting. We also show the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies of different present-day visual morphologies and stellar masses. Our analysis suggests that half of the mass in present-day elliptical galaxies was in place 11 Gyr ago. In other morphological types, the stellar mass formed later, up to 6 Gyr ago for present-day irregular galaxies. Similarly, the most massive galaxies in our sample were shown to have formed half their stellar mass by 11 Gyr ago, whereas the least massive galaxies reached this stage as late as 4 Gyr ago (the well-known effect of 'galaxy downsizing'). Finally, our metallicity approach allows us to follow the average evolution in gas-phase metallicity for populations of galaxies and extract the evolution of the cosmic metal mass density in stars and in gas, producing results in broad agreement with independent, higher redshift observations of metal densities in the Universe.},

Beyond z{\textasciitilde}1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is flat or even increasing, contrary to early indications of a turnover. Some recent analyses of z{\textasciitilde}6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a decline from z=3 to z{\textasciitilde}6, but there is still very little constraint on the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a decade, numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density spanning z=0 to as high as z{\textasciitilde}6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy evolution, and a summary of existing SFR density measurements is presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the entire range 0Q] and density evolution [φ{\textasciitilde}(1+z)P] is found. Combining the constraints from the global SFR density evolution with those from the 1.4 GHz radio source counts at submillijansky levels allows this degeneracy to be broken and a best-fitting evolutionary form to be established. The preferred evolution in a H0=70,ΩM=0.3,ΩΛ=0.7 cosmology from these combined constraints is Q=2.70+/-0.60, P=0.15+/-0.60.},

Adopting a Baldry-Glazebrook initial mass function we use these relations and apply PEGASE.2 to predict the z = 0 cosmic spectral energy distributions (CSEDs) of spheroids and discs. The model predictions compare favourably to the dust-corrected CSED recently reported by the Galaxy And Mass Assembly team from the far-ultraviolet through to the K band. The model also provides a reasonable fit to the total stellar mass contained within spheroid and disc structures as recently reported by the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue team. Three interesting inferences can be made following our axioms: (1) there is a transition redshift at z ≈ 1.7 at which point the Universe switches from what we refer to as `hot mode evolution' (i.e. spheroid formation/growth via mergers and/or collapse) to what we term `cold mode evolution' (i.e. disc formation/growth via gas infall and minor mergers); (2) there is little or no need for any pre-enrichment prior to the main phase of star formation; (3) in the present Universe mass loss is fairly evenly balanced with star formation holding the integrated stellar mass density close to a constant value. The model provides a simple prediction of the energy output from spheroid and disc projenitors, the build-up of spheroid and disc mass and the mean metallicity enrichment of the Universe.},

The constraints are based on an observational compilation that includes observations in the rest-frame IR, B band, UV, soft, and hard X-ray in past decades. Our method follows Hopkins et al. with an updated quasar SED model and bolometric and extinction corrections. The new best-fitting bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves qualitatively different from the old Hopkins model at high redshift. Compared with the old model, the number density normalization decreases towards higher redshift and the bright-end slope is steeper at z ≳ 2. Due to the paucity of measurements at the faint end, the faint end slope at z ≳ 5 is quite uncertain. We present two models, one featuring a progressively steeper faint-end slope at higher redshift and the other featuring a shallow faint-end slope at z ≳ 5. Further multiband observations of the faint-end QLF are needed to distinguish between these models. The evolutionary pattern of the bolometric QLF can be interpreted as an early phase likely dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the CXB spectrum, the SMBH mass density, and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only becomes important at z ≲ 3. The predicted CXB spectrum, cosmic SMBH mass density, and SMBH mass function are generally consistent with existing observations.},

AGN can also leave an imprint on a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED) through the re-processing of photons by the dusty torus. Using the SED fitting code PROSPECT with an incorporated AGN component, we fit the far-ultraviolet to far-infrared SEDs of {\textasciitilde}494 000 galaxies in the D10-COSMOS field and {\textasciitilde}230 000 galaxies from the GAMA survey. By combining an AGN component with a flexible star formation and metallicity implementation, we obtain estimates for the AGN luminosities, stellar masses, star formation histories, and metallicity histories for each of our galaxies. We find that PROSPECT can identify AGN components in 91 per cent of galaxies pre-selected as containing AGN through narrow-emission line ratios and the presence of broad lines. Our PROSPECT-derived AGN luminosities show close agreement with luminosities derived for X-ray selected AGN using both the X-ray flux and previous SED fitting results. We show that incorporating the flexibility of an AGN component when fitting the SEDs of galaxies with no AGN has no significant impact on the derived galaxy properties. However, in order to obtain accurate estimates of the stellar properties of AGN host galaxies, it is crucial to include an AGN component in the SED fitting process. We use our derived AGN luminosities to map the evolution of the AGN luminosity function for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 and find good agreement with previous measurements and predictions from theoretical models.},

	abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z{\textasciitilde}6, with especially tight constraints for z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino (νe) flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

Our values agree well with previously reported measurements and constitute a representative and homogeneous data set spanning a broad range in stellar-mass (108-1012 M⊙), dust-mass (106-109 M⊙), and star formation rates (0.01-100 M⊙yr-1), and over a broad redshift range (0.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0). We combine these data to measure the cosmic star formation history (CSFH), the stellar-mass density (SMD), and the dust-mass density (DMD) over a 12 Gyr timeline. The data mostly agree with previous estimates, where they exist, and provide a quasi-homogeneous data set using consistent mass and star formation estimators with consistent underlying assumptions over the full time range. As a consequence our formal errors are significantly reduced when compared to the historic literature. Integrating our CSFH we precisely reproduce the SMD with an interstellar medium replenishment factor of 0.50 ± 0.07, consistent with our choice of Chabrier initial mass function plus some modest amount of stripped stellar mass. Exploring the cosmic dust density evolution, we find a gradual increase in dust density with lookback time. We build a simple phenomenological model from the CSFH to account for the dust-mass evolution, and infer two key conclusions: (1) For every unit of stellar mass which is formed 0.0065-0.004 units of dust mass is also formed. (2) Over the history of the Universe approximately 90-95 per cent of all dust formed has been destroyed and/or ejected.},

	abstract = {We present the observed fraction of galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) as a function of environment in the early data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Using 4921 galaxies in the redshift range 0.05{\textless}=z{\textless}=0.095 and brighter than M(r*)=-20.0 (or M*+1.45), we find at least {\textasciitilde}20\% of these galaxies possess an unambiguous detection of an AGN, but this fraction could be as high as {\textasciitilde}=40\% after we model the ambiguous emission-line galaxies in our sample. We have studied the environmental dependence of galaxies, using the local galaxy density as determined from the distance to the 10th nearest neighbor. As expected, we observe that the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with density, while the fraction of passive galaxies (no emission lines) increases with density. In contrast, the fraction of galaxies with an AGN remains constant from the cores of galaxy clusters to the rarefied field population. We conclude that the presence of an AGN is independent of the disk component of a galaxy. We have extensively tested our results, and they are robust against measurement error, definition of an AGN, aperture bias, stellar absorption, survey geometry, and signal-to-noise ratio. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a supermassive black hole resides in the bulge of all massive galaxies, and {\textasciitilde}=40\% of these black holes are seen as AGNs in our sample. A high fraction of local galaxies with an AGN suggests either that the mean lifetime of these AGNs is longer than previously thought (i.e., {\textgreater}=108 yr) or that the AGNs burst more often than expected: {\textasciitilde}40 times over the redshift range of our sample.

	abstract = {IRAS flux densities, redshifts, and infrared luminosities are reported for all sources identified in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS), a complete flux-limited survey of all extragalactic objects with total 60 μm flux density greater than 5.24 Jy, covering the entire sky surveyed by IRAS at Galactic latitudes {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textgreater}5°. The RBGS includes 629 objects, with median and mean sample redshifts of 0.0082 and 0.0126, respectively, and a maximum redshift of 0.0876. The RBGS supersedes the previous two-part IRAS Bright Galaxy Samples (BGS1+BGS2), which were compiled before the final (Pass 3) calibration of the IRAS Level 1 Archive in 1990 May. The RBGS also makes use of more accurate and consistent automated methods to measure the flux of objects with extended emission. The RBGS contains 39 objects that were not present in the BGS1+BGS2, and 28 objects from the BGS1+BGS2 have been dropped from RBGS because their revised 60 μm flux densities are not greater than 5.24 Jy. Comparison of revised flux measurements for sources in both surveys shows that most flux differences are in the range {\textasciitilde}5\%-25\%, although some faint sources at 12 and 25 μm differ by as much as a factor of 2. Basic properties of the RBGS sources are summarized, including estimated total infrared luminosities, as well as updates to cross identifications with sources from optical galaxy catalogs established using the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. In addition, an atlas of images from the Digitized Sky Survey with overlays of the IRAS position uncertainty ellipse and annotated scale bars is provided for ease in visualizing the optical morphology in context with the angular and metric size of each object. The revised bolometric infrared luminosity function, φ(Lir), for infrared-bright galaxies in the local universe remains best fit by a double power law, φ(L){\textasciitilde}Lα, with α=-0.6(+/-0.1) and α=-2.2(+/-0.1) below and above the ``characteristic'' infrared luminosity L*ir{\textasciitilde}1010.5Lsolar, respectively. A companion paper provides IRAS High Resolution (HIRES) processing of over 100 RBGS sources where improved spatial resolution often provides better IRAS source positions or allows for deconvolution of close galaxy pairs.},

The redshift distribution of these SPIRE sources from the Herschel Multitiered Extragalactic Survey peaks at z = 0.85, with 731 sources at z {\textless} 2 and a tail of sources out to z ∼ 5. We measure more significant disagreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts (〈Δz/(1 + zspec)〉 = 0.29) than is seen in non-infrared selected samples, likely due to enhanced star formation rates and dust obscuration in infrared-selected galaxies. The infrared data are used to directly measure integrated infrared luminosities and dust temperatures independent of radio or 24 μm flux densities. By probing the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) at its peak, we estimate that the vast majority (72\%–83\%) of z {\textless} 2 Herschel-selected galaxies would drop out of traditional submillimeter surveys at 0.85–1 mm. We find that dust temperature traces infrared luminosity, due in part to the SPIRE wavelength selection biases, and partially from physical effects. As a result, we measure no significant trend in SPIRE color with redshift; if dust temperature were independent of luminosity or redshift, a trend in SPIRE color would be expected. Composite infrared SEDs are constructed as a function of infrared luminosity, showing the increase in dust temperature with luminosity, and subtle change in near-infrared and mid-infrared spectral properties. Moderate evolution in the far-infrared (FIR)/radio correlation is measured for this partially radio-selected sample, with qIR∝(1 + z)−0.30 ± 0.02 at z {\textless} 2. We estimate the luminosity function and implied star formation rate density contribution of HSGs at z {\textless} 1.6 and find overall agreement with work based on 24 μm extrapolations of the LIRG, ULIRG, and total infrared contributions. This work significantly increased the number of spectroscopically confirmed infrared-luminous galaxies at z ≫ 0 and demonstrates the growing importance of dusty starbursts for galaxy evolution studies and the build-up of stellar mass throughout cosmic time.},

	abstract = {Aims: We provide the most accurate estimate yet of the bright end of the infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) and the abundance of hyperluminous IR galaxies (HLIRGs) with IR luminosities {\textgreater}1013L⊙, thanks to the combination of the high sensitivity, angular resolution, and large area of the LOFAR Deep Fields, which probes an unprecedented dynamic range of luminosity and volume. Methods: We cross-match Herschel sources and LOFAR sources in Boötes (8.63 deg2), Lockman Hole (10.28 deg2), and ELAIS-N1 (6.74 deg2) with rms sensitivities of {\textasciitilde}32, 22, and 20 μJy beam−1, respectively. We divide the matched samples into "unique" and "multiple" categories. For the multiple matches, we de-blend the Herschel fluxes using the LOFAR positions and the 150-MHz flux densities as priors. We perform spectral energy distribution fitting, combined with multi-wavelength counterpart identifications and photometric redshift estimates, to derive IR luminosities. Results: The depth of the LOFAR data allows us to identify highly complete ({\textasciitilde}92\% completeness) samples of bright Herschel sources with a simple selection based on the 250 μm flux density (45, 40, and 35 mJy in Boötes, Lockman Hole, and ELAIS-N1, respectively). Most of the bright Herschel sources fall into the unique category (i.e. a single LOFAR counterpart). For the multiple matches, there is excellent correspondence between the radio emission and the far-IR emission. We find a good agreement in the IR LFs with a previous study out to z {\textasciitilde} 6 which used de-blended Herschel data. Our sample gives the strongest and cleanest indication to date that the population of HLIRGs has surface densities of {\textasciitilde}5 to {\textasciitilde}18/deg2 (with variations due to a combination of the applied flux limit and cosmic variance) and an uncertainty of a factor of ≲2. In comparison, the GALFORM semi-analytic model significantly under-predicts the abundance of HLIRGs.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive investigation of the cosmological evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared (IR). Based on the observed dichotomy in the ages of stellar populations of early-type galaxies on one side and late-type galaxies on the other, the model interprets the epoch-dependent luminosity functions at z {\textgreater}= 1.5 using a physical approach for the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies and of the associated AGNs, while IR galaxies at z {\textless} 1.5 are interpreted as being mostly late-type "cold" (normal) and "warm" (starburst) galaxies. As for proto-spheroids, in addition to the epoch-dependent luminosity functions of stellar and AGN components separately, we have worked out, for the first time, the evolving luminosity functions of these objects as a whole (stellar plus AGN component), taking into account in a self-consistent way the variation with galactic age of the global spectral energy distribution. The model provides a physical explanation for the observed positive evolution of both galaxies and AGNs up to z {\textasciitilde}= 2.5 and for the negative evolution at higher redshifts, for the sharp transition from Euclidean to extremely steep counts at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, as well as the (sub-)millimeter counts of strongly lensed galaxies that are hard to account for by alternative, physical or phenomenological, approaches. The evolution of late-type galaxies and z {\textless} 1.5 AGNs is described using a parametric phenomenological approach. The modeled AGN contributions to the counts and to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) are always sub-dominant. They are maximal at mid-IR wavelengths: the contribution to the 15 and 24 μm counts reaches 20\% above 10 and 2 mJy, respectively, while the contributions to the CIB are of 8.6\% and of 8.1\% at 15 μm and 24 μm, respectively. The model provides a good fit to the multi-wavelength (from the mid-IR to millimeter waves) data on luminosity functions at different redshifts and on number counts (both global and per redshift slices). A prediction of the present model, useful to test it, is a systematic variation with wavelength of the populations dominating the counts and the contributions to the CIB intensity. This implies a specific trend for cross-wavelength CIB power spectra, which is found to be in good agreement with the data.},

The answer to both questions is that red galaxies are dominating in the IR. This is true no matter whether color is defined in the rest-frame UV, optical, or optical-near-IR. We do find, however, that among the reddest galaxies in the rest-frame optical, there is a population of sources with only little mid-IR emission, suggesting a quiescent nature.},

	abstract = {We report the first results from the Z -FOURGE survey: the discovery of a candidate galaxy cluster at z = 2.2 consisting of two compact overdensities with red galaxies detected at {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 20σ above the mean surface density. The discovery was made possible by a new deep (Ks {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 24.8 AB 5σ) Magellan/FOURSTAR near-IR imaging survey with five custom medium-bandwidth filters. The filters pinpoint the location of the Balmer/4000 Å break in evolved stellar populations at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5, yielding significantly more accurate photometric redshifts than possible with broadband imaging alone. The overdensities are within 1' of each other in the COSMOS field and appear to be embedded in a larger structure that contains at least one additional overdensity ({\textasciitilde}10σ). Considering the global properties of the overdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of a galaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. A comparison to a large ΛCDM simulation suggests that the system may consist of merging subclusters, with properties in between those of z {\textgreater} 2 protoclusters with more diffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusters with prominent red sequences. The structure is completely absent in public optical catalogs in COSMOS and only weakly visible in a shallower near-IR survey. The discovery showcases the potential of deep near-IR surveys with medium-band filters to advance the understanding of environment and galaxy evolution at z {\textgreater} 1.5.

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well.

	abstract = {We examine the infrared properties of 43 high-redshift (0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2), infrared-luminous galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), selected by a deep 70μm survey with the Multiband Imaging Photometer on Spitzer (MIPS). In addition and with reference to starburst-type spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we derive a set of equations for estimating the total infrared luminosity (LIR) in the range 8-1000μm using photometry from at least one MIPS band. 42 out of 43 of our sources' optical/infrared SEDs (λobserved {\textless} 160 μm) are starburst type, with only one object displaying a prominent power-law near-infrared continuum. For a quantitative analysis, models of radiation transfer in dusty media are fit on to the infrared photometry, revealing that the majority of galaxies are represented by high extinction, Av {\textgreater} 35, and for a large fraction ({\textasciitilde}50 per cent) the SED turns over into the Rayleigh-Jeans regime at wavelengths longward of 90μm. For comparison, we also fit semi-empirical templates based on local galaxy data; however, these underestimate the far-infrared SED shape by a factor of at least 2 and in extreme cases up to 10 for the majority ({\textasciitilde}70 per cent) of the sources. Further investigation of SED characteristics reveals that the mid-infrared (70/24μm) continuum slope is decoupled from various galaxy properties such as the total infrared luminosity and far-infrared peak, quantified by the L160/L70 ratio. In view of these results, we propose that these high-redshift galaxies have different properties to their local counterparts, in the sense that large amounts of dust cause heavy obscuration and are responsible for an additional cold emissive component, appearing as a far-infrared excess in their SEDs.},

We present the results from deep 24 μm imaging from Spitzer surveys, which include {\textasciitilde}5×104 sources to an 80\% completeness of {\textasciitilde}=60 μJy. The 24 μm counts rapidly rise at near-Euclidean rates down to 5 mJy, increase with a super-Euclidean rate between 0.4 and 4 mJy, and converge below {\textasciitilde}0.3 mJy. The 24 μm counts exceed expectations from nonevolving models by a factor of {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 at Sν{\textasciitilde}0.1 mJy. The peak in the differential number counts corresponds to a population of faint sources that is not expected from predictions based on 15 μm counts from the Infrared Space Observatory. We argue that this implies the existence of a previously undetected population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}1-3. Integrating the counts to 60 μJy, we derive a lower limit on the 24 μm background intensity of 1.9+/-0.6 nW m-2 sr-1 of which the majority ({\textasciitilde}60\%) stems from sources fainter than 0.4 mJy. Extrapolating to fainter flux densities, sources below 60 μJy contribute 0.8+0.9-0.4 nW m-2 sr-1 to the background, which provides an estimate of the total 24 μm background of 2.7+1.1-0.7 nW m-2 sr-1.

	abstract = {We carried out direct measurement of the fraction of dusty sources in a sample of extremely red galaxies with (R-Ks){\textgreater}=5.3 mag and Ks{\textless}20.2 mag, using 24 μm data from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Combining deep 24 μm Ks- and R-band data over an area of {\textasciitilde}64 arcmin2 in ELAIS N1 of the Spitzer First Look Survey (FLS), we find that 50\%+/-6\% of our extremely red object (ERO) sample have measurable 24 μm flux above the 3 σ flux limit of 40 μJy. This flux limit corresponds to a star formation rate (SFR) of 12 Msolar yr-1 at z{\textasciitilde}1, much more sensitive than any previous long-wavelength measurement. The 24 μm-detected EROs have 24 μm/2.2 μm and 24 μm/0.7 μm flux ratios consistent with infrared luminous, dusty sources at z{\textgreater}=1, and are an order of magnitude too red to be explained by an infrared quiescent spiral or a pure old stellar population at any redshift. Some of these 24 μm-detected EROs could be active galactic nuclei; however, the fraction among the whole ERO sample is probably small, 10\%-20\%, as suggested by deep X-ray observations as well as optical spectroscopy. Keck optical spectroscopy of a sample of similarly selected EROs in the FLS field suggests that most of the EROs in ELAIS N1 are probably at z{\textasciitilde}1. The mean 24 μm flux (167 μJy) of the 24 μm-detected ERO sample roughly corresponds to the rest-frame 12 μm luminosity, νLν(12μm), of 3×1010Lsolar at z{\textasciitilde}1. Using the correlation between IRAS νLν(12μm) and infrared luminosity LIR(8-1000μm), we infer that the IR{\textgreater} of the 24 μm-detected EROs is 3×1011 and 1×1012Lsolar at z=1.0and1.5, respectively, similar to that of local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The corresponding SFR would be roughly 50-170 Msolar yr-1. If the timescale of this starbursting phase is on the order of 108 yr as inferred for the local LIRGs and ULIRGs, the lower limit on the masses of these 24 μm-detected EROs is 5×109to2×1010Msolar. It is plausible that some of the starburst EROs are in the midst of a violent transformation to become massive early type galaxies at the epoch of z{\textasciitilde}1-2.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ∼1\% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in ∼10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

Near its peak, three-quarters of the cosmic infrared background is now resolved into individually detected sources. The use of far-infrared diagnostics of dust-obscured star formation and of interstellar medium conditions has expanded from extreme and rare extreme high-redshift galaxies to more typical main-sequence galaxies and hosts of active galactic nuclei out to z≳2. These studies shed light on the evolving role of steady equilibrium processes and of brief starbursts at and since the peak of cosmic star formation and black hole accretion.

Powerful, highly ionized winds, with velocities â¼0.1-0.2c, are a common feature in X-ray spectra of luminous AGNs, offering a plausible physical origin for the well-known connections between the hole and properties of its host. Observability constraints suggest that the winds must be episodic and detectable only for a few percent of their lifetimes. The most powerful wind feedback, establishing the M⊙ relation, is probably not directly observable at all. The M⊙ relation signals a global change in the nature of AGN feedback. At black hole masses below M⊙ feedback is confined to the immediate vicinity of the hole. At the M⊙ mass, it becomes much more energetic and widespread and can drive away much of the bulge gas as a fast molecular outflow.},

This obscuration presents an important challenge for uncovering the complete AGN population and understanding the cosmic evolution of SMBHs. In this review, we describe a broad range of multiwavelength techniques that are currently being employed to identify obscured AGN, and we assess the reliability and completeness of each technique. We follow with a discussion of the demographics of obscured AGN activity, explore the nature and physical scales of the obscuring material, and assess the implications of obscured AGN for observational cosmology.

Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of SED shapes, as well as their dependence on luminosity, makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey. We infer the QLF break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z{\textasciitilde}4.5 and confirm at high significance ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 σ) previous claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the column density distribution and quasar SED, which both depend on luminosity, a single bolometric QLF self-consistently reproduces the observed QLFs in all bands and at all redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this luminosity dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric QLF and there is no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find that they are consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total quasar luminosity density is well constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. We provide a number of fitting functions to the bolometric QLF and its manifestations in various bands, as well as a script to return the QLF at arbitrary frequency and redshift from these fits.},

	abstract = {Infrared (IR) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution, since their most intense stages are often obscured by dust. However, local IR luminosity function estimates today are still based on the IRAS survey in the 1980s, with wavelength coverage only up to 100 μm. The AKARI IR space telescope performed an all-sky survey in six IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140 and 160 μm) with 3-10 times better sensitivity, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can much more precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (LTIR) of individual galaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the local Universe. By fitting modern IR spectral energy distribution (SED) models, we have remeasured LTIR of the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample, which is a complete sample of local galaxies with S60 μm {\textgreater} 5.24 Jy. We present mid-IR monochromatic luminosity (νLν) to LTIR correlations for Spitzer8 μm, AKARI9 μm, IRAS12 μm, WISE12 μm, ISO15 μm, AKARI18 μm, WISE22 μm and Spitzer24 μm filters. These measures of LMIR are well correlated with LTIR, with scatter in the range 13-44 per cent. The best-fitting LMIR-to-LTIR conversions provide us with estimates of LTIR using only a single MIR band, in which several deep all-sky surveys are becoming available such as AKARI MIR and WISE. Although we have found some overestimates of LTIR by IRAS due to contaminating cirrus/sources, the resulting AKARI IR luminosity function (LF) agrees well with that from IRAS. We integrate the LF weighted by LTIR to obtain a cosmic IR luminosity density of ΩTIR= (8.5+1.5-2.3) × 107 L⊙ Mpc-3, of which 7 ± 1 per cent is produced by luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) (LTIR {\textgreater} 1011 L⊙), and only 0.4 ± 0.1 per cent is from ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) (LTIR {\textgreater} 1012 L⊙) in the local Universe, in stark contrast to high-redshift results. We separate the contributions from AGN and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The SFG IR LF shows a steep decline at the bright end. Combined with high-redshift results from the AKARI NEP deep survey, these data show a strong evolution of ΩSFTIR∝ (1 +z)4.0±0.5 and ΩAGNTIR∝ (1 +z)4.4±0.4. For ΩAGNTIR, the ULIRG contribution exceeds that from LIRGs already by z∼ 1. A rapid evolution in both ΩAGNTIR and ΩSFGTIR suggests the correlation between star formation and black hole accretion rate continues up to higher redshifts. We compare the evolution of ΩAGNTIR to that of X-ray luminosity density. The ΩAGNTIR/ΩX-ray AGN ratio shows a possible increase at z {\textgreater} 1, suggesting an increase of obscured AGN at z {\textgreater} 1.},

	abstract = {We present a new backward evolution model for galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared (IR). What is new in this model is the separate study of the evolutionary properties of different IR populations (i.e. spiral galaxies, starburst galaxies, low-luminosity AGNs, 'unobscured' type 1 AGNs and 'obscured' type 2 AGNs) defined through a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of large samples of IR-selected sources. The evolutionary parameters have been constrained by means of all the available observables from surveys in the mid- and far-IR (source counts, redshift and luminosity distributions, luminosity functions). By decomposing the SEDs representative of the three AGN classes into three distinct components (a stellar component emitting most of its power in the optical/near-IR, an AGN component due to the hot dust heated by the central black hole peaking in the mid-IR, and a starburst component dominating the far-IR spectrum), we have disentangled the AGN contribution to the monochromatic and total IR luminosity emitted by different populations considered in our model from that due to star formation activity. We have then obtained an estimate of the total IR luminosity density [and star formation density (SFD) produced by IR galaxies] and the first ever estimate of the black hole mass accretion density (BHAR) from the IR. The derived evolution of the BHAR is in agreement with estimates from X-rays, though the BHAR values we derive from the IR are slightly higher than the X-ray ones. Finally, we have simulated source counts, redshift distributions, and SFD and BHAR that we expect to obtain with the future cosmological surveys in the mid-/far-IR that will be performed with the JWST-MIRI and SPICA-SAFARI. Outputs of the model are available online.1},

	abstract = {We investigate what shapes the infrared luminosity function of local galaxies by comparing it to the local infrared active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity function. The former corresponds to emission from dust heated by stars and AGN, whereas the latter includes emission from AGN-heated dust only. Our results show that infrared emission from AGN starts mixing into the galaxy luminosity function in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) regime and becomes significant in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) regime, with the luminosity above which local ULIRGs become AGN-dominated being in the logL\_IR/L\_\{⊙ \}∼ 12.2-12.7 range. We propose that as a result of the AGN contribution, the infrared galaxy luminosity function has a flatter high-luminosity slope than UV/optical galaxy luminosity functions. Furthermore, we note that the increased AGN contribution as a function of LIR is reflected in the average dust temperature (Tdust) of local galaxies, and may be responsible for the local LIR-Tdust relation. However, although our results show that AGN play a central role in defining the properties of local ULIRGs, we find that the dominant power source in the local ULIRG population is star formation.},

	abstract = {We present Spitzer 7-38 μm spectra for a 24 μm flux-limited sample of galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 0.7 in the COSMOS field. The detailed high-quality spectra allow us to cleanly separate star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) in individual galaxies. We first decompose mid-infrared luminosity functions (LFs). We find that the SF 8 μm and 15 μm LFs are well described by Schechter functions. AGNs dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads to the shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared LFs. The total infrared (8-1000 μm) LF from 70 μm selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-end slope than the bolometrically corrected SF 15 μm LF, owing to the intrinsic dispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. We then study the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (BHs). Seven of the thirty-one luminous infrared galaxies with Spitzer spectra host luminous AGNs, implying an AGN duty cycle of 23\% ± 9\%. The time-averaged ratio of BH accretion rate and SF rate matches the local M BH - M bulge relation and the M BH - M host relation at z {\textasciitilde} 1. These results favor co-evolution scenarios in which BH growth and intense SF happen in the same event but the former spans a shorter lifetime than the latter. Finally, we compare our mid-infrared spectroscopic selection with other AGN identification methods and discuss candidate Compton-thick AGNs in the sample. While only half of the mid-infrared spectroscopically selected AGNs are detected in X-ray, {\textasciitilde}90\% of them can be identified with their near-infrared spectral indices.},

	abstract = {Context. Studies of the infrared (IR) emission of cosmic sources have proven essential to constraining the evolutionary history of cosmic star formation and the gravitational accretion of nuclear black holes, because many of these events occur inside heavily dust-extinguished environments. Aims: The Spitzer Space Telescope has provided a large amount of data to constrain the nature and cosmological evolution of infrared source populations. In the present paper we exploit a large homogeneous dataset to derive a self-consistent picture of IR emission based on the time-dependent λ\_eff = 24, 15, 12, and 8 μm monochromatic and bolometric IR luminosity functions (LF) over the full 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 redshift range. Methods: Our present analysis is based on a combination of data from deep Spitzer surveys of the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS-SWIRE) and GOODS fields. To our limiting flux of S24 = 400 μJy, our sample derived from VVDS-SWIRE includes 1494 sources, and 666 and 904 sources brighter than S24 = 80 μJy are catalogued in GOODS-S and GOODS-N, respectively, for a total area of {\textasciitilde}0.9 square degrees. Apart from a few galaxies, we obtain reliable optical identifications and redshifts for all these sources, providing a rich and robust dataset for our luminosity function determination. The final combined reliable sample includes 3029 sources, the fraction with photometric redshifts being 72\% over all redshifts and almost all galaxies at z {\textgreater} 1.5. Based on the multiwavelength information available in these areas, we constrain the LFs at 8, 12, 15, and 24 μm. We also infer the total IR luminosities from our best-fit model of the observed SEDs of each source, and use this to derive the bolometric (8-1000 μm) LF and comoving volume emissivity to z {\textasciitilde} 2.5. Results: In the redshift interval 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1, the bolometric IR luminosity density evolves as (1 + z)3.8±0.4. Although it is more uncertain at higher-z, our results show a flattening in the IR luminosity density at z {\textgreater} 1. The mean redshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: the brightest IR galaxies appear to form stars at earlier cosmic times (z {\textgreater} 1.5), while star formation in the less luminous galaxies continues until more recent epochs (z {\textasciitilde} 1 for LIR {\textless} 1011 L⊙), in overall agreement with similar analyses in the literature. Conclusions: Our results are indicative of a rapid increase in the galaxy IR comoving volume emissivity up to z {\textasciitilde} 1 and a constant average emissivity at z {\textgreater} 1. We also appear to measure a difference in the evolutionary rate of the source number densities as a function of luminosity, which is consistent with the downsizing evolutionary patterns reported for other samples of cosmic sources.},

We detect very strong luminosity evolution for the total IR LF (LIR ∝ (1 + z)3.55 ± 0.10 up to z ∼ 2, and ∝ (1 + z)1.62 ± 0.51 at 2 {\textless} z ≲ 4) combined with a density evolution (∝(1 + z)-0.57 ± 0.22 up to z ∼ 1 and ∝ (1 + z)-3.92 ± 0.34 at 1 {\textless} z ≲ 4). In agreement with previous findings, the IR luminosity density (ρIR) increases steeply to z ∼ 1, then flattens between z ∼ 1 and z ∼ 3 to decrease at z ≳ 3. Galaxies with different spectral energy distributions, masses and specific star formation rates (SFRs) evolve in very different ways and this large and deep statistical sample is the first one allowing us to separately study the different evolutionary behaviours of the individual IR populations contributing to ρIR. Galaxies occupying the well-established SFR-stellar mass main sequence (MS) are found to dominate both the total IR LF and ρIR at all redshifts, with the contribution from off-MS sources (≥0.6 dex above MS) being nearly constant (∼20 per cent of the total ρIR) and showing no significant signs of increase with increasing z over the whole 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.2 range. Sources with mass in the range 10 ≤ log(M/M⊙) ≤ 11 are found to dominate the total IR LF, with more massive galaxies prevailing at the bright end of the high-z (≳2) LF. A two-fold evolutionary scheme for IR galaxies is envisaged: on the one hand, a starburst-dominated phase in which the Super Massive Black Holes (SMBH) grows and is obscured by dust (possibly triggered by a major merging event), is followed by an AGN-dominated phase, then evolving towards a local elliptical. On the other hand, moderately star-forming galaxies containing a low-luminosity AGN have various properties suggesting they are good candidates for systems in a transition phase preceding the formation of steady spiral galaxies.},

	abstract = {The 60-micron luminosity function for galaxies detected by IRAS is determined from a compilation of samples with highly complete redshift information totalling 2818 galaxies, including the new QMC-Cambridge-Durham survey and samples include many nearby, low-luminosity galaxies. We use clustering-independent maxi likelihood methods throughout. A non-parametric estimator is used to determined shape of the luminosity function, and the best parameter set found for a suitable analytic form. We find the luminosity function to be well described by a Gaussian dependence on log(luminosity), changing over to a very flat power law at low luminosities: this latter feature is in strong contrast to previous results. We find results to be very insensitive to various models for deviations from the Hubble flow and to different values of the Hubble constant. We present a generalization of the non-parametric estimator for determination of the bivariate luminosity function of samples defined by two flux limits. We apply this to two optically + 60-micron limited samples containing relatively large numbers of low-luminosity galaxies and confirm the flatness of the luminosity function at this end. The joint luminosity function suggests simple forms for the distribution of 60-micron luminosity versus blue luminosity and linear diameter, and we determine maximum likelihood solutions for these forms. In addition, we determine the 40-120 micron far-infrared luminosity function, and derive separate 60-micron luminosity function for the normal and starburst populations, as classified by far-infrared temperature. We also present a new method for finding the run of density against distance for any flux and/or magnitude limited sample, independent of any assumptions on the shape of the luminosity function. Large local overdensities are found, confirming the existence of bias in previous work. This method forms an excellent indicator for evolution, and strong evolution [luminosity is proportional to (1 + z){\textasciicircum}3+/-1{\textasciicircum} or density is proportional to (1 + z){\textasciicircum}7+/-2{\textasciicircum}] is seen in the QCD survey. The combination of luminosity function and density estimator allows us to investigate the internal consistency of our results, and we find no evidence that systematic errors outweigh the statistical uncertainties.},

Using z {\textless} 0.1 bivariate distributions as a reference we model the higher-z distributions, thereby approximating a correction for the missing optically faint star-forming galaxies to the local star formation rate (SFR) and M densities. Furthermore, we obtain the r-band luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions of Hα star-forming galaxies from the bivariate LFs. As our sample is selected on the basis of detected Hα emission, a direct tracer of ongoing star formation, this sample represents a true star-forming galaxy sample, and is drawn from both photometrically classified blue and red subpopulations, though mostly from the blue population. On average 20-30 per cent of red galaxies at all stellar masses are star forming, implying that these galaxies may be dusty star-forming systems.},

	abstract = {The ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 has a very low velocity dispersion, indicating that it has little or no dark matter. Here we report the discovery of a second galaxy in this class, residing in the same group. NGC1052-DF4 closely resembles NGC1052-DF2 in terms of its size, surface brightness, and morphology; has a similar distance of \{D\vphantom{\{}\}sbf\}=19.9+/- 2.8 \{Mpc\}; and also has a population of luminous globular clusters extending out to ≥slant 7 \{kpc\} from the center of the galaxy. Accurate radial velocities of the diffuse galaxy light and seven of the globular clusters were obtained with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. The velocity of the diffuse light is identical to the median velocity of the clusters, \{v\vphantom{\{}\}sys\}={\textless} \{v\vphantom{\{}\}gc\}{\textgreater} =1445 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1, and close to the central velocity of the NGC 1052 group. The rms spread of the globular cluster velocities is very small at \{σ \vphantom{\{}\}obs\}=5.8 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1. Taking observational uncertainties into account we determine an intrinsic velocity dispersion of \{σ \vphantom{\{}\}intr\}=\{4.2\}-2.2+4.4 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1, consistent with the expected value from the stars alone (\{σ \vphantom{\{}\}stars\}≈ 7 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1) and lower than expected from a standard NFW halo (\{σ \vphantom{\{}\}halo\}∼ 30 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1). We conclude that NGC1052-DF2 is not an isolated case but that a class of such objects exists. The origin of these large, faint galaxies with an excess of luminous globular clusters and an apparent lack of dark matter is, at present, not understood.},

	abstract = {Recently a population of large, very low surface brightness, spheroidal galaxies was identified in the Coma cluster. The apparent survival of these ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in a rich cluster suggests that they have very high masses. Here, we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the largest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope. We find a velocity dispersion of σ =\{47\}-6+8 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1, which implies a dynamical mass of \{M\}\{dyn\}({\textless} \{r\}1/2)=\{0.7\}-0.2+0.3× \{10\}10 \{M\}⊙ within its deprojected half-light radius of \{r\}1/2=4.6+/- 0.2 \{kpc\}. The mass-to-light ratio is M/\{L\}I({\textless} \{r\}1/2)=\{48\}-14+21 \{M\}⊙ /\{L\}⊙ , and the dark matter fraction is 98\% within \{r\}1/2. The high mass of Dragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population. From deep Gemini imaging taken in 0{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} 4 seeing we infer that Dragonfly 44 has \{94\}-20+25 globular clusters, similar to the counts for other galaxies in this mass range. Our results add to other recent evidence that many UDGs are “failed” galaxies, with the sizes, dark matter content, and globular cluster systems of much more luminous objects. We estimate the total dark halo mass of Dragonfly 44 by comparing the amount of dark matter within r=4.6 \{kpc\} to enclosed mass profiles of NFW halos. The enclosed mass suggests a total mass of ∼ \{10\}12 \{M\}⊙ , similar to the mass of the Milky Way. The existence of nearly dark objects with this mass is unexpected, as galaxy formation is thought to be maximally efficient in this regime.},

Many of them (332) are Milky Way (MW) sized with very large effective radii of \{r\}\{e\} 1.5 \{kpc\}. This study was motivated by the recent discovery of 47 UDGs by Dokkum et al.; our discovery suggests 1000 UDGs after accounting for the smaller Subaru field (4.1 \{\{degree\}\}2; about one-half of Dragonfly). The new Subaru UDGs show a distribution concentrated around the cluster center, strongly suggesting that the great majority are (likely longtime) cluster members. They are a passively evolving population, lying along the red sequence in the color-magnitude diagram with no signature of Hα emission. Star formation was, therefore, quenched in the past. They have exponential light profiles, effective radii \{r\}\{e\}∼ 800{\textbackslash}\{pc\}-5 \{kpc\}, effective surface brightnesses \{μ \}\{e\}(\{{\textbackslash}text\{\}\}R) = 25-28 mag arcsec-2, and stellar masses ∼ 1× \{10\}7\{{\textbackslash}text\{\}\}\{M\}⊙ -5× \{10\}8\{{\textbackslash}text\{\}\}\{M\}⊙ . There is also a population of nucleated UDGs. Some MW-sized UDGs appear closer to the cluster center than previously reported; their survival in the strong tidal field, despite their large sizes, possibly indicates a large dark matter fraction protecting the diffuse stellar component. The indicated baryon fraction ≲ 1\% is less than the cosmic average, and thus the gas must have been removed (from the possibly massive dark halo). The UDG population is elevated in the Coma cluster compared to the field, indicating that the gas removal mechanism is related primarily to the cluster environment.},

The objects have central surface brightness μ(g, 0) ranging from 24-26 mag arcsec-2 and effective radii r eff = 3''-10'', as measured from archival Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope images. From their spatial distribution we infer that most or all of the objects are galaxies in the Coma cluster. This relatively large distance is surprising as it implies that the galaxies are very large: with r eff = 1.5-4.6 kpc their sizes are similar to those of L * galaxies even though their median stellar mass is only {\textasciitilde}6 × 107 M ⊙. The galaxies are relatively red and round, with langg - irang = 0.8 and langb/arang = 0.74. One of the 47 galaxies is fortuitously covered by a deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) observation. The ACS imaging shows a large spheroidal object with a central surface brightness μ475 = 25.8 mag arcsec-2, a Sérsic index n = 0.6, and an effective radius of 7'', corresponding to 3.4 kpc at the distance of Coma. The galaxy is not resolved into stars, consistent with expectations for a Coma cluster object. We speculate that these "ultra-diffuse galaxies" may have lost their gas supply at early times, possibly resulting in very high dark matter fractions.},

Here, we report the structural properties of five UDGs in the Perseus cluster based on deep Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging. Three appear GC-poor and two appear GC-rich. One of our sample, PUDG\_R24, appears to be undergoing quenching and is expected to fade into the UDG regime within the next {\textasciitilde}0.5 Gyr. We target this sample with Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectroscopy to investigate differences in their dark matter haloes, as expected from their differing GC content. Our spectroscopy measures both recessional velocities, confirming Perseus cluster membership, and stellar velocity dispersions, to measure dynamical masses within their half-light radius. We supplement our data with that from the literature to examine trends in galaxy parameters with GC system richness. We do not find the correlation between GC numbers and UDG phase space positioning expected if GC-rich UDGs environmentally quench at high redshift. We do find GC-rich UDGs to have higher velocity dispersions than GC-poor UDGs on average, resulting in greater dynamical mass within the half-light radius. This agrees with the first order expectation that GC-rich UDGs have higher halo masses than GC-poor UDGs.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) COSMOS radio observations at 3 GHz to infer radio luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies up to redshifts of z 5 based on approximately 6000 detections with reliable optical counterparts. This is currently the largest radio-selected sample available out to z 5 across an area of 2 square degrees with a sensitivity of rms ≈ 2.3 μJy beam-1. By fixing the faint and bright end shape of the radio luminosity function to the local values, we find a strong redshift trend that can be fitted with a pure luminosity evolution L1.4 GHz ∝ (1 + z)(3.16 ± 0.2)-(0.32 ± 0.07)z. We estimate star formation rates (SFRs) from our radio luminosities using an infrared (IR)-radio correlation that is redshift dependent. By integrating the parametric fits of the evolved luminosity function we calculate the cosmic SFR density (SFRD) history since z 5. Our data suggest that the SFRD history peaks between 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 3 and that the ultraluminous infrared galaxies (100 M⊙ yr-1 {\textless} SFR {\textless} 1000 M⊙ yr-1) contribute up to 25\% to the total SFRD in the same redshift range. Hyperluminous infrared galaxies (SFR {\textgreater} 1000 M⊙ yr-1) contribute an additional ≲2\% in the entire observed redshift range. We find evidence of a potential underestimation of SFRD based on ultraviolet (UV) rest-frame observations of Lyman break galaxies at high redshifts (z ≳ 4) on the order of 15-20\%, owing to appreciable star formation in highly dust-obscured galaxies, which might remain undetected in such UV observations.},

We present alignments between radio jets and cold molecular gas in the environment of distant radio galaxies, and show that the brightness of the radio synchrotron source can be enhanced by its interplay with the molecular gas. Our work is based on CO J {\textgreater} 1 observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of three radio galaxies with redshifts in the range 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.1, namely MRC 0114-211 (z = 1.41), MRC 0156-252 (z = 2.02), and MRC 2048-272 (z = 2.05). These ALMA observations support previous work that found molecular gas out to 50 kpc in the circumgalactic environment, based on a CO(1–0) survey performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The CO emission is found along the radio axes but beyond the main radio lobes. When compared to a large sample of high-z radio galaxies from the literature, we find that the presence of this cold molecular medium correlates with an increased flux-density ratio of the main versus counter-lobe. This suggest that the radio lobe brightens when encountering cold molecular gas in the environment. While part of the molecular gas is likely related to the interstellar medium from either the host or a companion galaxy, a significant fraction of the molecular gas in these systems shows very low excitation, with r 2−1/1−0 and r 3−2/1−0 values ≲0.2. This could be part of the circumgalactic medium.},

We constrained the evolution of this population via continuous models of pure density and pure luminosity evolutions, and we found best-fit parametrizations of Φ∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.00 ± 0.18) - (0.60 ± 0.14)z, and L∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.88 ± 0.82) - (0.84 ± 0.34)z, respectively, with a turnover in number and luminosity densities of the population at z ≈ 1.5. We converted 1.4 GHz luminosity to kinetic luminosity taking uncertainties of the scaling relation used into account. We thereby derived the cosmic evolution of the kinetic luminosity density provided by the AGN and compared this luminosity density to the radio-mode AGN feedback assumed in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) model, I.e., to the redshift evolution of the central supermassive black hole accretion luminosity taken in the model as the source of heating that offsets the energy losses of the cooling, hot halo gas, and thereby limits further stellar mass growth of massive galaxies. We find that the kinetic luminosity exerted by our radio AGN may be high enough to balance the radiative cooling of the hot gas at each cosmic epoch since z 5. However, although our findings support the idea of radio-mode AGN feedback as a cosmologically relevant process in massive galaxy formation, many simplifications in both the observational and semi-analytic approaches still remain and need to be resolved before robust conclusions can be reached.},

We search for large, extended molecular gas reservoirs among 46 previously detected CO(1-0) emitters, employing a customised method we developed. Based on the CO emission images and position-velocity diagrams, as well as the ranking of sources using a binary weighting of six different criteria, we have identified 14 robust and 7 tentative candidates that exhibit large extended molecular gas reservoirs. These extended reservoirs are defined as having sizes greater than 40 kpc or super-galactic scale. This result suggests a high frequency of extended gas reservoirs, comprising at least {\textbackslash}(30 {\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}) of our CO-selected sample. An environmental study of the candidates is carried out based on N-th nearest neighbour and we find that the large molecular gas reservoirs tend to exist in denser regions. The spatial distribution of our candidates is mainly centred on the core region of the Spiderweb protocluster. The performance and adaptability of our method are discussed. We found 13 (potentially) extended gas reservoirs located in nine galaxy (proto)clusters from the literature. We noticed that large extended molecular gas reservoirs surrounding (normal) star-forming galaxies in protoclusters are rare. This may be attributable to the lack of observations low-J CO transitions and the lack of quantitative analyses of molecular gas morphologies. The large gas reservoirs in the Spiderweb protocluster are a potential source of the intracluster medium seen in low redshift Virgo- or Coma-like galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Qz, which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 σ scatter in Δ z/(1 + z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

	abstract = {Recent works have suggested that energy balance spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes may be of limited use for studying high-redshift galaxies for which the observed ultraviolet and far-infrared emission are offset (spatially ‘decoupled’). It has been proposed that such offsets could lead energy balance codes to miscalculate the overall energetics, preventing them from recovering such galaxies’ true properties. In this work, we test how well the SED fitting code magphys can recover the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, dust mass, and luminosity by fitting 6706 synthetic SEDs generated from four zoom-in simulations of dusty, high-redshift galaxies from the FIRE project via dust continuum radiative transfer. Comparing our panchromatic results (using wavelengths 0.4–500 μm, and spanning 1 \&lt; z \&lt; 8) with fits based on either the starlight (\${\textbackslash}lambda \_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\} {\textbackslash}le 2.2{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu\$m) or dust (\${\textbackslash}ge 100{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu\$m) alone, we highlight the power of considering the full range of multiwavelength data alongside an energy balance criterion. Overall, we obtain acceptable fits for 83 per cent of the synthetic SEDs, though the success rate falls rapidly beyond z ≈ 4, in part due to the sparser sampling of the priors at earlier times since SFHs must be physically plausible (i.e. shorter than the age of the universe). We use the ground truth from the simulations to show that when the quality of fit is acceptable, the fidelity of magphys estimates is independent of the degree of UV/FIR offset, with performance very similar to that previously reported for local galaxies.},

	abstract = {The distribution in space and both the optical and radio luminosity functions of quasi-stellar radio sources are derived The derivation is based on quasi-stellar sources in the Revised 3C Catalogue, in which they have been identified and observed with a high degree of completeness down to magnitude around 18k. The redshifts are assumed to be cosmological. The distribution in space is found to be strongly non-uniform. The space density, in co-moving coordinates, is increasing with redshift z, such that at z = 1 the density is around 150 and 80 times the local (z = 0) density, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. This density increase corresponds to a N(S) relation quite {\textasciitilde}imi1ar to that exhibited by extragalactic radio sources. The optical luminosity function is relatively flat, i e., the numbers per magnitude depend little on the luminosity In contrast the radio luminosity function is rather steep, the number per magnitude increas- ing toward fainter radio luminosities by a factor of around three to four per magnitude. Extension of this radio luminosity function by 1{\textasciitilde} magnitude is sufficient to account for the Sandage-Luyten estimate of the sky density of quasi-stellar objects. The local (z = 0) density of quasi-stellar objects can then be estimated at 7 X 1O{\textasciitilde} and 12 X 1O-{\textasciitilde} Mpc3, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively.

	abstract = {Aims: Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. Methods: For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale \& Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. Results: For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 μm, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 Å, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 1011 M⊙ towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. Conclusions: The results for our SINGS test sample demonstrate that CIGALE can be a valuable tool for studying basic properties of galaxies in the near and distant Universe if UV-to-IR data are available.},

	abstract = {We study two galaxies samples selected in near-ultraviolet (NUV) and in far-infrared (FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far-UV (FUV) to the FIR are available. We compared the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus burst) and dust attenuation laws (power law + 2175 Åbump). The Bayesian method allows one to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from SED analysis if the FIR information is not used. The dispersion is larger than with the FIR data. The distribution is also not symmetrically distributed about zero: there is an overestimation for UV-selected galaxies and an underestimation for FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud extinction law while FIR-selected galaxies attenuation laws resemble more the Milky Way extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the log (Fdust/FFUV) versus FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV - NUV accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameters b0 for UV-selected galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for UV galaxies only (that should only be used whenever the FIR information is not available because the resulting AFUV is poorly defined with an uncertainty of about 0.32): AFUV= 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)2+ 0.3298 (NUV-I)2+ 2.1207 (FUV-NUV) + 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408.},

	abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven-year sky survey which began in 2005 May. UKIDSS is being carried out using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has the largest étendue of any infrared astronomical instrument to date. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000deg2 to a depth of K {\textasciitilde} 18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35deg2 to K {\textasciitilde} 21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77deg2 to K {\textasciitilde} 23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long-term astronomical legacy data base; the design is, however, driven by a series of specific goals - for example, to find the nearest and faintest substellar objects, to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist, to determine the substellar mass function, to break the z = 7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionization, to measure the growth of structure from z = 3 to the present day, to determine the epoch of spheroid formation, and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed. Images and catalogues are being made available through a fully queryable user interface - the WFCAM Science Archive (http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). The data are being released in stages. The data are immediately public to astronomers in all ESO member states, and available to the world after 18 months. Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortia collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release, we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposure of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS), using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Eleven individual pointings made between 1999 October and 2000 December were combined to generate the final image used for object detection. Catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two different methods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the SExtractor algorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for Chandra observations. The detection threshold has been set in order to have less than 10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. We subdivided the catalog into four sections. The primary list consists of objects common to the two detection methods. Two secondary lists contain sources which were detected by (1) the SExtractor algorithm alone and (2) the wavelet technique alone. The fourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. The flux limits at the aimpoint for the soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) bands are 5.5×10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 and 4.5×10-16 erg s-1 cm-2, respectively. The total number of sources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5-2 keV band, and 251 in the 2-10 keV band. We also present optical identifications for the cataloged sources. Our primary optical data are R band imaging from VLT/FORS1 to a depth of R{\textasciitilde}26.5 (Vega). In regions of the field not covered by the VLT/FORS1 deep imaging, we use R-band data obtained with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the ESO-MPI 2.2 m telescope, as part of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS), which cover the entire X-ray survey. We found that the FORS1/Chandra offsets are small, {\textasciitilde}1". Coordinate cross-correlation finds 85\% of the Chandra sources covered by FORS1 R to have counterparts within the 3 σ error box ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1.5" depending on off-axis angle and X-ray signal-to-noise). The unidentified fraction of sources, approximately {\textasciitilde}10\%-15\%, is close to the limit expected from the observed X-ray flux to R-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.},

	abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) and star formation rate (SFR) for Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-mass progenitors from z = 0.2 to 2.5. We source galaxies from the Ks-band-selected ZFOURGE survey, which includes multiwavelength data spanning 0.3-160 μm. We use decomposition software to split the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our galaxies into their active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star-forming components, which allows us to estimate BHARs and SFRs from the infrared (IR). We perform tests to check the robustness of these estimates, including a comparison with BHARs and SFRs derived from X-ray stacking and far-IR analysis, respectively. We find that, as the progenitors evolve their relative black hole-galaxy growth (i.e. their BHAR/SFR ratio) increases from low to high redshift. The MW-mass progenitors exhibit a log-log slope of 0.64 ± 0.11, while the M31-mass progenitors are 0.39 ± 0.08. This result contrasts with previous studies that find an almost flat slope when adopting X-ray-/AGN-selected or mass-limited samples and is likely due to their use of a broad mixture of galaxies with different evolutionary histories. Our use of progenitor-matched samples highlights the potential importance of carefully selecting progenitors when searching for evolutionary relationships between BHAR/SFRs. Additionally, our finding that BHAR/SFR ratios do not track the rate at which progenitors quench casts doubts over the idea that the suppression of star formation is predominantly driven by luminous AGN feedback (i.e. high BHARs).},

	abstract = {We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates within the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) to determine the impact they have on star formation in their host galaxies. We first identify a population of radio, X-ray, and infrared-selected AGN by cross-matching the deep Ks-band imaging of ZFOURGE with overlapping multiwavelength data. From this, we construct a mass-complete (log(M\_\{\{*\}\}/M\_\{\{⊙\}\}) ≥9.75), AGN luminosity limited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2-3.2. We compare the rest-frame U - V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the AGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using 160 μm Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star formation rate of AGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34 ± 0.07 dex with respect to the control sample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by infrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much as a factor of ∼5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and postulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating galaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.},

	abstract = {We present the J-band luminosity function (LF) of 1838 mid-infrared and X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.85. These LFs are constructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broadband observations from the UV to the mid-IR of the NDWFS Boötes field with the X-ray observations of the XBoötes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field by AGES. Our sample is primarily composed of IRAC-selected AGNs, targeted using modifications of the Stern et al. criteria, complemented by MIPS 24 μm and X-ray-selected AGNs to alleviate the biases of IRAC mid-IR selection against z {\textasciitilde} 4.5 quasars and AGNs faint with respect to their hosts. This sample provides an accurate link between low- and high-redshift AGN LFs and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness of optical samples at z {\textasciitilde} 3. We use a set of low-resolution spectral energy distribution templates for AGNs and galaxies presented in a previous paper by Assef et al. to model the selection function of these sources and apply host and reddening corrections. We find that the space density of the brightest quasars strongly decreases from z = 3 to z = 0, while the space density of faint quasars is at least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. At z{\textgreater}3, we observe a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. We model the LF by a double power law and find that its evolution cannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, but must be a combination of both. We used the bright-end slope determined by Croom et al. (2QZ) as a prior to fit the data in order to minimize the effects of our small survey area. The bright-end power-law index of our best-fit model remains consistent with the prior, while the best-fit faint-end index is consistent with the low-redshift measurements based on the 2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys. Our best-fit model generally agrees with the number of bright quasars predicted by other LFs at all redshifts. If we construct the QSO luminosity function using only the IRAC-selected AGNs, we find that the biases inherent to this selection method significantly modify the behavior of the characteristic density phi*(z) only for z {\textless} 1 and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude M *,J (z).},

The well defined IRAC samples contain 3800-5800 galaxies for the 3.6-8.0 μm bands with spectroscopic redshifts and z {\textless} 0.6. We obtained relatively complete luminosity functions in the local redshift bin of z {\textless} 0.2 for all four IRAC channels that are well fitted by Schechter functions. After analyzing the samples for the whole redshift range, we found significant evolution in the luminosity functions for all four IRAC channels that can be fitted as an evolution in M * with redshift, ΔM * = Qz. While we measured Q = 1.2 ± 0.4 and 1.1 ± 0.4 in the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands consistent with the predictions from a passively evolving population, we obtained Q = 1.8 ± 1.1 in the 8.0 μm band consistent with other evolving star formation rate estimates. We compared our luminosity functions with the predictions of semianalytical galaxy formation and found the best agreement at 3.6 and 4.5 μm, rough agreement at 8.0 μm, and a large mismatch at 5.8 μm. These models also predicted a comparable Q-value to our luminosity functions at 8.0 μm, but predicted smaller values at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We also measured the luminosity functions separately for early- and late-type galaxies. While the luminosity functions of late-type galaxies resemble those for the total population, the luminosity functions of early-type galaxies in the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands indicate deviations from the passive evolution model, especially from the measured flat luminosity density evolution. Combining our estimates with other measurements in the literature, we found 53 ± 18\% of the present stellar mass of early-type galaxies was assembled at z = 0.7.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]λ5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hδ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

In addition, we present a compilation of ultraviolet, infrared and H α SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z {\textless} 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic star formation rates (SFRs) for z ∼ 0-8 as well. We demonstrate that supernovae feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR ∼1-10 M⊙ yr-1 dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z ≤ 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR ∼10-100 M⊙ yr-1) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (z ∼ 2) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR ∼10-100 M⊙ yr-1 would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively rare high-mass haloes (MHalo ∼ 1011-13 M⊙) even at the earliest epochs.},

The composite X-ray to IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGNs, which are used to compare the hard X-ray LF (HXLF) and the IRLF, are modelled with a simple, but well-tested torus model, based on the radiative transfer and photoionization code, CLOUDY. Four observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10 keV HXLF and six evolution models of the obscured type 2 AGN fraction (f2) are considered. The 8.0- and 15-?m LFs for unobscured type 1, obscured type 2 and all AGNs are predicted from the HXLFs, and then compared with the measurements currently available. We find that the IRLFs predicted from the HXLFs tend to underestimate the number of the most IR-luminous AGNs. This is independent of the choices of HXLF and f2, and this is even more obvious for the HXLFs recently measured. We show that the discrepancy between the HXLFs and IRLFs can be largely resolved when the anticorrelation between the ultraviolet (UV) to X-ray slope αox and UV luminosity LUV is appropriately considered. We also discuss other possible explanations for the discrepancy, such as the missing population of Compton-thick AGNs and the possible contribution of star formation in the host to the mid-IR. Meanwhile, we find that the HXLFs and IRLFs of AGNs might be more consistent with each other if the obscuration mechanisms of quasars and Seyferts are assumed to be different, corresponding to their different triggering and fuelling mechanisms. In order to clarify these interesting issues, it would be very helpful to obtain more accurate measurements of the IRLFs of AGNs, especially those determined at smaller redshift bins, and to more accurately separate the measurements for type 1 and type 2 AGNs.},

	abstract = {Context. Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their spectral energy distribution (SED). Aims: We present a completely new implementation of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE). Written in python, its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities. Methods: To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution. Results: CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications.

	abstract = {The detection of X-ray emission constitutes a reliable and efficient tool for the selection of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), although it may be biased against the most heavily absorbed AGNs. Simple mid-infrared (IR) broad-band selection criteria identify a large number of luminous and absorbed AGNs, yet again host contamination could lead to non-uniform and incomplete samples. Spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition is able to decouple the emission from the AGN versus that from star-forming regions, revealing weaker AGN components. We aim to identify the obscured AGN population in the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey in the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey W1 field through SED modelling. We construct SEDs for 6860 sources and identify 160 AGNs at a high confidence level using a Bayesian approach. Using optical spectroscopy, we confirm the nature of ∼85 per cent of the AGNs. Our AGN sample is highly complete (∼92 per cent) compared to mid-IR colour-selected AGNs, including a significant number of galaxy-dominated systems with lower luminosities. In addition to the lack of X-ray emission (80 per cent), the SED fitting results suggest that the majority of the sources are obscured. We use a number of diagnostic criteria in the optical, IR, and X-ray regimes to verify these results. Interestingly, only 35 per cent of the most luminous mid-IR-selected AGNs have X-ray counterparts suggesting strong absorption. Our work emphasizes the importance of using SED decomposition techniques to select a population of type II AGNs, which may remain undetected by either X-ray or IR colour surveys.},

First, spectral decomposition is carried out by adopting the Bayesian exchange Monte Carlo method for various artificial spectral data, and the confidence interval of fitting parameters is evaluated. From the results, an approximated model formula that expresses the confidence interval of parameters and the relationship between the peak-to-peak distance and the signal-to-noise ratio is derived. Next, for real spectral data, we compare the confidence interval of each peak parameter obtained using the Bayesian exchange Monte Carlo method with the confidence interval obtained from the BIC-fitting with the model selection function and the proposed approximated formula. We thus confirm that the parameter confidence intervals obtained using the two methods agree well. It is therefore possible to not only simply estimate the appropriate number of peaks by BIC-fitting but also obtain the confidence interval of fitting parameters.},

	abstract = {The spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies is a complex function of the star formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas in galaxies. The computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiation through the dust distribution is time-consuming. This aspect becomes unacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analytical galaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then compared with multi-wavelength surveys. Mainly for this aim, we have implemented an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiative transfer code grasil in order to compute the SED of galaxies in a short computing time. This allows to avoid the adoption of empirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies output by models. The ANN has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum (the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-forming molecular clouds (MC) and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties and dependencies). We have defined the input neurons effectively determining their emission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and is not linked to a particular galaxy formation model. We have trained the net for the disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce the SED of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model for spheroidal galaxies. We have checked that for this model both the SEDs and the galaxy counts in the Herschel bands obtained with the ANN approximation are almost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full grasil. We conclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present the application to a more complex SAM in another paper.},

However, modern ground-based surveys now probe volumes large enough to discover AGNs at depths sensitive enough for fainter galaxies, bridging these two populations. Using these observations as constraints, we present a methodology to empirically jointly model the evolution of the rest-UV LFs at z = 3–9. Our critical assumptions are that both populations have LFs well described by double power laws modified to allow for a flattening at the faint-end, and that all LF parameters evolve smoothly with redshift. This methodology provides a good fit to the observations and makes predictions to volume densities not yet observed, finding that the volume density of bright (M UV = −28) AGNs rises by ∼105 from z = 9 to z = 3, while bright (M UV = −21) star-forming galaxies rise by only ∼102 across the same epoch. The observed bright-end flattening of the z = 9 LF is unlikely to be due to AGN activity, and rather is due to a shallowing of the bright-end slope, implying a reduction of feedback in bright galaxies at early times. The intrinsic ionizing emissivity is dominated by star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3, even after applying a notional escape fraction. We find decent agreement between our AGN LFs and predictions based on different black hole seeding models, though all models underpredict the observed abundance of bright AGNs. We show that the wide-area surveys of the upcoming Euclid and Roman observatories should be capable of discovering AGNs to z ∼ 8.},

Meanwhile, the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies depends strongly on the environment. This shows that the global environmental density is an important factor in the formation of elliptical galaxies.

Some observations suggest that many z {\textasciitilde} 6-9 galaxies are dominated by ≳200 Myr stellar populations, implying significant star formation at z ≳ 9, while others find that most reionization era galaxies are ≲10 Myr, consistent with little z ≳ 9 star formation. Here, we quantify the distribution of ages of UV-bright (\$-22.5{\textbackslash}lesssim M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}small UV\}{\textbackslash}lesssim -21\$) galaxies colour-selected to lie at z ≃ 6.6-6.9, an ideal redshift range to systematically study the SFHs of reionization era galaxies with ground-based observatories and Spitzer. We infer galaxy properties with two SED modelling codes and compare results, finding that stellar masses are largely insensitive to the model, but the inferred ages can vary by an order of magnitude. We infer a distribution of ages assuming a simple, parametric SFH model, finding a median age of {\textasciitilde}30-70 Myr depending on SED model. We quantify the fractions of ≤10 and ≥250 Myr galaxies, finding that these systems comprise {\textasciitilde}15-30 per cent and {\textasciitilde}20-25 per cent of the population, respectively. With a flexible SFH model, the shapes of the SFHs are consistent with those implied by the simple model (e.g. young galaxies have rapidly rising SFHs). However, stellar masses can differ significantly, with those of young systems sometimes being more than an order of magnitude larger with the flexible SFH. We quantify the implications of these results for z ≳ 9 stellar mass assembly and discuss improvements expected from JWST.},

We present a minimal physical model that explains the observed galaxy abundance at z = 10-14.

It has been successfully tested on well-known UV LFs up to z = 7. We argue that the weak evolution from z = 7 to z ≈ 14 of the LF bright-end can arise from a conspiracy between a decreasing dust attenuation, making galaxies brighter, that almost exactly compensates for the increasing shortage of their host halos. Our minimal model naturally reproduces the z = 10-14 LF if galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}lower.5ex{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}buildrel {\textbackslash}over {\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},\}11\$ contain a negligible amounts of dust.

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive synthesis model for the active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution and the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Universe. We assume that black holes accrete in just three distinct physical states, or `modes': at low Eddington ratio, only a radiatively inefficient, kinetically dominated mode is allowed [low kinetic (LK)] at high Eddington ratio, instead, AGN may display both a purely radiative [radio quiet, high radiative (HR)] and a kinetic [radio loud, high kinetic (HK)] mode. We solve the continuity equation for the black hole mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary condition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth rate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric correction and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous semi-analytic and numerical models for black hole growth, we do not assume any specific distribution of Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass and luminosity functions and a set of fundamental relations between observables in the three accretion modes. SMBH always show a very broad accretion rate distribution, and we discuss the profound consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed AGN fractions in galaxies, as well as for the empirical determination of SMBH mass functions with large surveys. We confirm previous results and clearly demonstrate that, at least for z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1.5, SMBH mass function evolves antihierarchically, i.e. the most massive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first time, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts above the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z {\textasciitilde} 2). We also derive tight constraints on the (mass-weighted) average radiative efficiency of AGN: under the simplifying assumption that the mass density of both high redshift (z {\textasciitilde} 5) and `wandering' black holes ejected from galactic nuclei after merger events are negligible compared to the local mass density, we find that 0.065 {\textless} ξ0{\textless}ɛrad{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.07, where ξ0 is the local SMBH mass density in units of 4.3 × 105MsolarMpc-3. We trace the cosmological evolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and find that the overall efficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest mass energy into kinetic power, ɛkin, ranges between ɛkin {\textasciitilde}= (3-5) × 10-3, depending on the choice of the radio core luminosity function. Such a `kinetic efficiency' varies however strongly with SMBH mass and redshift, being maximal for very massive holes at late times, as required for the AGN feedback by many galaxy formation models in cosmological contexts.},

Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

	abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0-6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z {\textasciitilde} 0.2-2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of {\textasciitilde}L* gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z gtrsim 1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas and investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. We present new IRAM PdBI CO(1-0) observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasar-hosts: a clear signature of massive and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of several 100 M⊙ yr-1. We combine these new observations with data from the literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their star formation rate (SFR), or even higher by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which is found to increase with the LAGN/Lbol ratio. The gas depletion time scales due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in starburst galaxies down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts, the depletion time scales due to the outflow are much shorter than the depletion time scales due to star formation. We estimate the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it corresponds to about 5\% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 LAGN/c are common among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For "pure" starburst galaxies, our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds. Overall, our results indicate that, although starbursts are effective in powering massive molecular outflows, the presence of an AGN may strongly enhance such outflows, and therefore have a profound feedback effect on the evolution of galaxies by efficiently removing fuel for star formation, hence quenching star formation.

	abstract = {A major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is the inclusion of so-called active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The energy input from an active central massive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies at later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and compelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In search for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16000 early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data base (MOSES: Morphologically Selected Ellipticals in SDSS). Key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion through visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against recent star formation and nuclear activity. Based on the nebular emission-line characteristics we separate between star formation activity, black hole activity, the composite of the two and quiescence. We find that emission is mostly LINER (low ionization nuclear emission line region) like in high-mass galaxies (σ {\textgreater} 200kms-1) and roughly evenly distributed between star formation and AGN at intermediate and low (σ {\textless} 100kms-1) masses. The objects with emission ({\textasciitilde}20 per cent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the colour-mass diagram. Star-forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while early-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red sequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two extremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel method that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) and stellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the red sequence star formation occurred several 100Myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from star formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process lasts about 1Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the starburst. The most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressed by nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence. This is empirical evidence for the occurrence of AGN feedback in early-type galaxies at recent epochs.},

Here we investigate the relationship between BH mass and host galaxy total stellar mass using a sample of 262 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the nearby universe (z {\textless} 0.055), as well as 79 galaxies with dynamical BH masses. The vast majority of our AGN sample is constructed using Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and searching for Seyfert-like narrow-line ratios and broad Hα emission. BH masses are estimated using standard virial techniques. We also include a small number of dwarf galaxies with total stellar masses Mstellar ≲ 109.5 M⊙ and a subsample of the reverberation-mapped AGNs. Total stellar masses of all 341 galaxies are calculated in the most consistent manner feasible using color-dependent mass-to-light ratios. We find a clear correlation between BH mass and total stellar mass for the AGN host galaxies, with MBH ∝ Mstellar, similar to that of early-type galaxies with dynamically detected BHs. However, the relation defined by the AGNs has a normalization that is lower by more than an order of magnitude, with a BH-to-total stellar mass fraction of MBH/Mstellar ∼ 0.025\% across the stellar mass range 108 ≤ Mstellar/M⊙ ≤ 1012. This result has significant implications for studies at high redshift and cosmological simulations in which stellar bulges cannot be resolved.},

The key ingredients of the simulations are gas, stars, black holes (BHs), self-gravity, star formation and stellar feedback (via a subgrid model); BH feedback is not included. We use {\textasciitilde}100 simulations to survey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the interstellar medium physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic nuclei ({\textless}{\textasciitilde} 300pc) using galaxy-scale simulations, including both major galaxy mergers and isolated bar-(un)stable disc galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems, we find that a series of gravitational instabilities generates large accretion rates of up to {\textasciitilde} 1-10 Msolar yr-1 on to the BH (i.e. at {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1pc) this is comparable to what is needed to fuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable for a given set of conditions in the galaxy at {\textasciitilde}kpc. At radii of {\textgreater}rsim 10 pc, our simulations resemble the `bars-within-bars' model of Shlosman et al., but we show that the gas can have a diverse array of morphologies, including spirals, rings, clumps and bars; the duty cycle of these features is modest, complicating attempts to correlate BH accretion with the morphology of gas in galactic nuclei. At {\textasciitilde} 1-10 pc, the gravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no longer present. However, we show that the gas can become unstable to a standing, eccentric disc or a single-armed spiral mode (m = 1), in which the stars and gas precess at different rates, driving the gas to sub-pc scales (again for sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems). A proper treatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity of both the stars and gas (which has not been the case in many previous calculations). Our simulations predict a correlation between the BH accretion rate and the star formation rate at different galactic radii. We find that nuclear star formation is more tightly coupled to active galactic nucleus activity than the global star formation rate of a galaxy, but a reasonable correlation remains even for the latter.},

	abstract = {Context. Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is often identified as the main mechanism responsible for regulating star formation in active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies. However, the relationships between AGN activity, radiation, winds, and star formation are complex and still far from being understood. Aims: We study scaling relations between AGN properties, host galaxy properties, and AGN winds. We then evaluate the wind mean impact on the global star formation history, taking into account the short AGN duty cycle with respect to that of star formation. Methods: We first collect AGN wind observations for 94 AGN with detected massive winds at sub-pc to kpc spatial scales. We then fold AGN wind scaling relations with AGN luminosity functions, to evaluate the average AGN wind mass-loading factor as a function of cosmic time. Results: We find strong correlations between the AGN molecular and ionised wind mass outflow rates and the AGN bolometric luminosity. The power law scaling is steeper for ionised winds (slope 1.29 ± 0.38) than for molecular winds (0.76 ± 0.06), meaning that the two rates converge at high bolometric luminosities. The molecular gas depletion timescale and the molecular gas fraction of galaxies hosting powerful AGN driven winds are 3-10 times shorter and smaller than those of main sequence galaxies with similar star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and redshift. These findings suggest that, at high AGN bolometric luminosity, the reduced molecular gas fraction may be due to the destruction of molecules by the wind, leading to a larger fraction of gas in the atomic ionised phase. The AGN wind mass-loading factor η = ṀOF/SFR is systematically higher than that of starburst driven winds. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that AGN winds are, on average, powerful enough to clean galaxies from their molecular gas only in massive systems at z ≲ 2, I.e. a strong form of co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies appears to break down for the least massive galaxies.},

	abstract = {We use a coupled model of the formation and evolution of galaxies and black holes (BHs) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a cold dark matter universe. The model is embedded in the galaxy formation code GALFORM and predicts the masses, spins and mass accretion histories of BHs in tandem with the formation of their host galaxies. BHs grow by accretion during starbursts, triggered by discs becoming dynamically unstable or by galaxy mergers, and accretion from quasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes. Using an empirical law for AGN obscuration, our model matches the observed luminosity functions (LFs) of AGNs over a wide range of redshifts. Due to the suppression of cooling in massive haloes by AGN feedback, at low redshift (z≲ 2), the brightest quasars (Lbol≳ 1046 erg s-1) are predicted preferentially to inhabit haloes with masses ?. The model predicts a hierarchical buildup of BH mass, with the typical mass of actively growing BHs increasing with decreasing redshift. Nevertheless, the model displays clear 'downsizing' as reflected in the differential evolution of the space density of faint and bright AGNs. This arises naturally from the interplay between the starburst and hot gas halo accretion modes. The faint end of the LF is dominated by massive BHs accreting at low rates via a thick disc, primarily during the hot-halo mode. The bright end is populated by BHs accreting close to or above the Eddington limit during the starburst mode. Obscuration plays a central role in determining the observed abundance of AGNs and, hence, in their implied cosmic evolution.},

	abstract = {The active galactic nuclei (AGN) X-ray luminosity function traces actively accreting supermassive black holes and is essential for the study of the properties of the AGN population, black hole evolution, and galaxy-black hole coevolution. Up to now, the AGN luminosity function has been estimated several times in soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard X-rays (2-10 keV). AGN selection in these energy ranges often suffers from identification and redshift incompleteness and, at the same time, photoelectric absorption can obscure a significant amount of the X-ray radiation. We estimate the evolution of the luminosity function in the 5-10 keV band, where we effectively avoid the absorbed part of the spectrum, rendering absorption corrections unnecessary up to N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}23{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Our dataset is a compilation of six wide, and deep fields: MAXI, HBSS, XMM-COSMOS, Lockman Hole, XMM-CDFS, AEGIS-XD, Chandra-COSMOS, and Chandra-CDFS. This extensive sample of {\textasciitilde}1110 AGN (0.01 \&lt; z \&lt; 4.0, 41 \&lt; log L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}x{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 46) is 98\% redshift complete with 68\% spectroscopic redshifts. For sources lacking a spectroscopic redshift estimation we use the probability distribution function of photometric redshift estimation specifically tuned for AGN, and a flat probability distribution function for sources with no redshift information. We use Bayesian analysis to select the best parametric model from simple pure luminosity and pure density evolution to more complicated luminosity and density evolution and luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE). We estimate the model parameters that describe best our dataset separately for each survey and for the combined sample. We show that, according to Bayesian model selection, the preferred model for our dataset is the LDDE. Our estimation of the AGN luminosity function does not require any assumption on the AGN absorption and is in good agreement with previous works in the 2-10 keV energy band based on X-ray hardness ratios to model the absorption in AGN up to redshift three. Our sample does not show evidence of a rapid decline of the AGN luminosity function up to redshift four.},

	abstract = {We present results on the spectral decomposition of 118 Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra from local active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using a large set of Spitzer/IRS spectra as templates. The templates are themselves IRS spectra from extreme cases where a single physical component (stellar, interstellar, or AGN) completely dominates the integrated mid-infrared emission. We show that a linear combination of one template for each physical component reproduces the observed IRS spectra of AGN hosts with unprecedented fidelity for a template fitting method with no need to model extinction separately. We use full probability distribution functions to estimate expectation values and uncertainties for observables, and find that the decomposition results are robust against degeneracies. Furthermore, we compare the AGN spectra derived from the spectral decomposition with sub-arcsecond resolution nuclear photometry and spectroscopy from ground-based observations. We find that the AGN component derived from the decomposition closely matches the nuclear spectrum with a 1σ dispersion of 0.12 dex in luminosity and typical uncertainties of ∼0.19 in the spectral index and ∼0.1 in the silicate strength. We conclude that the emission from the host galaxy can be reliably removed from the IRS spectra of AGNs. This allows for unbiased studies of the AGN emission in intermediate- and high-redshift galaxies—currently inaccesible to ground-based observations—with archival Spitzer/IRS data and in the future with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope.

Using infrared (IR) photometry (8-500 μ m), including deblended Spitzer and Herschel images and taking into account photometric upper limits, we decompose the IR spectral energy distributions into AGN and star formation components. Using the IR luminosities due to star formation, we investigate the average SFRs as a function of redshift and AGN luminosity. In agreement with previous studies, we find a strong evolution of the average SFR with redshift, tracking the observed evolution of the overall star-forming galaxy population. However, we find that the relationship between the average SFR and AGN luminosity is broadly flat at all redshifts and across all the AGN luminosities investigated; in comparison to previous studies, we find less scatter amongst the average SFRs across the wide range of AGN luminosities investigated. By comparing to empirical models, we argue that the observed flat relationship is due to short time-scale variations in AGN luminosity, driven by changes in the mass accretion rate, which wash out any underlying correlations between SFR and L\_AGN. Furthermore, we show that the exact form of the predicted relationship between SFR and AGN luminosity (and its normalization) is highly sensitive to the assumed intrinsic Eddington ratio distribution.},

We estimate an average dust covering factor (CF) of 33\% based on IR SEDs and bolometric AGN luminosity, corresponding to a Type 2 AGN population of roughly a third. We also see a population of AGN that challenge the inclination-based unification model with individual dust CFs that contradict the nuclear obscuration expected from observed X-ray hardness ratios. We see no strong connection between AGN fractions in the IR and corresponding total IR, 24 μm, or X-ray luminosities. The average rest-frame AGN contribution as a function of IR wavelength shows significant (∼80\%) contributions in the mid-IR that trail off at λ {\textgreater} 30 μm.

In the 6.88 deg2 field sampled, 79\% of the 4867 galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, allowing an accurate determination of the local (z{\textless}0.3) galaxy luminosity function. Stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis of observed galaxy colors. Dust emission (mostly PAH) accounts for 80\% of the 8 μm luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19\%, and AGN emission accounts for roughly 1\%. A subsample of the 8 μm-selected galaxies have blue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant PAH emission. The luminosity functions for the total 8 μm luminosity and for the dust emission alone are both well fit by Schechter functions. For the 8 μm luminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is νL*ν(8.0 μm)=1.8×1010 Lsolar, while for the dust emission alone it is 1.6×1010 Lsolar. The average 8 μm luminosity density at z{\textless}0.3 is 3.1×107 Lsolar Mpc-3, and the average luminosity density from dust alone is 2.5×107 Lsolar Mpc-3.

	abstract = {Empirical "backward" galaxy evolution models for infrared (IR) bright galaxies are constrained using multiband IR surveys. We developed a new Monte Carlo algorithm for this task, implementing luminosity-dependent distribution functions for the galaxies' IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contribution, allowing for evolution of these quantities. The adopted SEDs take into account the contributions of both starbursts and AGN to the IR emission, for the first time in a coherent treatment rather than invoking separate AGN and star-forming populations. In the first part of the paper we consider the quantification of the AGN contribution for local universe galaxies, as a function of the total IR luminosity. It is made using a large sample of luminous infrared galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies for which mid-IR spectra are available in the Spitzer archive. We find the ratio of AGN 6 μm luminosity and the total IR luminosity to rise with L 1.4 TIR over the IR luminosity range 1011-1013 L sun and estimate its spread. Judging from the modest number of distant sources with Spitzer spectroscopy, the relation changes at high-z. In the second part we present the model. Our best-fit model adopts very strong luminosity evolution, L = L 0(1 + z)3.4, up to z = 2.3, and density evolution, ρ = ρ0(1 + z)2, up to z = 1, for the population of IR galaxies. At higher z, the evolution rates drop as (1 + z)-1 and (1 + z)-1.5, respectively. To reproduce mid-IR to submillimeter number counts and redshift distributions, it is necessary to introduce both an evolution in the AGN contribution and an evolution in the luminosity-temperature relation. At a given total IR luminosity, high-redshift IR galaxies have typically smaller AGN contributions to the rest-frame mid-IR, and colder far-IR dust temperatures than locally. We also suggest an extension of the local IR galaxy population toward lower dust temperatures. Our models are in plausible agreement with current photometry-based estimates of the typical AGN contribution as a function of mid-IR flux, and well placed to be compared to upcoming Spitzer spectroscopic results. As an example of future applications, we use our best-fitting model to make predictions for surveys with Herschel.},

The 5-35 μm Infrared Spectrograph spectra allow us to estimate accurately the luminosities and build the LFs. Using a combination of starburst and quasar templates, we quantify the star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) contributions in the mid-IR spectral energy distribution. We then compute the SF LFs at 15 and 24 μm, and compare with the total 15 and 24 μm LFs. When we remove the contribution of AGNs, the bright end of the LF exhibits a strong decline, consistent with the exponential cutoff of a Schechter function. Integrating the differential LF, we find that the fractional contribution by SF to the energy density is 58\% at 15 μm and 78\% at 24 μm, while it goes up to {\textasciitilde}86\% when we extrapolate our mid-IR results to the total IR luminosity density. We confirm that the AGNs play more important roles energetically at high luminosities. Finally, we compare our results with work at z {\textasciitilde} 0.7 and confirm that evolution on both luminosity and density is required to explain the difference in the LFs at different redshifts.},

	abstract = {We study the contribution of hot-dust to the luminosity density of galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time. Using the Spitzer-IRAC data over an area of 1.8 deg2 covered by the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, we estimate the contribution from hot-dust at rest-frame 4.2 μm (from 0 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.2 up to 0.5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.9). This wavelength corresponds to blackbody temperature of {\textasciitilde}690 K. The contribution of stellar emission is estimated from the rest-frame 1.6 μm luminosity (assumed to result from stellar emission alone) and subtracted from the mid-infrared luminosity of galaxies to measure hot-dust emission. To attempt the study of the 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature, we use the rest-frame 4.2 μm to infer the hot-dust flux at 3.3 μm. This study is performed for different spectral types of galaxies: early-type, late-type, starburst, and IR-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that (1) the decrease of the hot-dust luminosity density since 0.5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1 is steeper (by at least 0.5 dex) compared with that of the cold-dust, giving support to the scenario where galaxy obscuration increases with redshift, as proposed in the literature; (2) hot-dust and PAH emission evolution seems to be correlated with stellar mass, where rest-frame 1.6 μm luminous non-AGN galaxies (i.e., massive systems) show a stronger decrement (with decreasing redshift) in hot-dust and PAH emission than the less luminous (less massive) non-AGN galaxies; (3) despite comprising {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 3\% of the total sample, AGN contribute as much as a third to the hot-dust luminosity density at z {\textless} 1 and clearly dominate the bright-end of the total hot-dust luminosity density function at 0.5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.9; (4) the average dust-to-total luminosity ratio increases with redshift, while PAH-to-total luminosity ratio remains fairly constant; (5) at M 1.6 {\textgreater} -25, the dust-to-total and PAH-to-total luminosity ratios increase with decreasing luminosity, but deeper data are required to confirm this result. Future study is necessary to further enlighten the characterization of the different spectral components at play in 2-5 μm spectral regime.},

	abstract = {Context. The form and evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at high redshifts provide crucial information on star formation history and mass assembly in the young Universe, close or even prior to the epoch of reionization. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We used the unique combination of deep optical/near-infrared/mid-infrared imaging provided by HST, Spitzer, and the VLT in the CANDELS-UDS, GOODS-South, and HUDF fields to determine the GSMF over the redshift range 3.5 ≤ z ≤ 7.5. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the HST WFC3/IR near-infrared imaging from CANDELS and HUDF09, reaching H ≃ 27 - 28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, in combination with associated deep HST ACS optical data, deep Spitzer IRAC imaging from the SEDS programme, and deep Y and K-band VLT Hawk-I images from the HUGS programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometric redshifts. These have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.5 ≤ z ≤ 7.5, resulting in an overall precision of σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}z{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ (1 + z) {\textasciitilde} 0.037. With this database we have determined the low-mass end of the high-redshift GSMF with unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as M{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at z = 4 and {\textasciitilde}6 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at z = 7. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find that the GSMF at 3.5 ≤ z ≤ 7.5 depends only slightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely the photometric redshifts, the star formation histories, the nebular contribution, or the presence of AGN in the parent sample. The low-mass end of the GSMF is steeper than has been found at lower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probed here. Meanwhile the high-mass end of the GSMF appears to evolve primarily in density, although there is also some evidence of evolution in characteristic mass. Our results are very different from previous mass function estimates based on converting UV galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight mass-to-light relations. Integrating our evolving GSMF over mass, we find that the growth of stellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the star formation rate density over cosmic time at z\&gt; 4. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: These results confirm the unique synergy of the CANDELS+HUDF, HUGS, and SEDS surveys for the discovery and study of moderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts, and reaffirm the importance of space-based infrared selection for the unbiased measurement of the evolving GSMF in the young Universe. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424750/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

Galaxies that are red in their [3.4]-[4.6] colour contain heated dust and the reddest systems ([3.4]-[4.6] {\textgreater} 0.5) are classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) by some selection criteria. The sample discussed here includes nearby galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that are also in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue. We calculate the number density of galaxies, in the form of the luminosity and mass functions, using the V/Vmax method and a stepwise maximum likelihood method that has been modified to account for the additional colour selection. The reddest galaxies which have [3.4]-[4.6] {\textgreater} 0.8 and are sometimes classified as AGN by their colour make up 0.2 per cent of nearby galaxies. However, the reddest galaxies are a rising fraction of the low-mass galaxy population. Identifying the lowest mass (M {\textless} 108 M⊙) red ([3.4]-[4.6] {\textgreater} 0.8) galaxies as AGN is surprising given that none are optical AGN or composites, in contrast with their more massive (M {\textgreater} 1010 M⊙) red galaxy counterparts that are dominated by optical AGN and composites (86.4 per cent). We also show that these low-mass red galaxies are associated with higher specific star formation rates than their bluer counterparts. While the properties of this relatively rare segment of nearby low-mass galaxies are intriguing, particularly if they are associated with AGN activity, there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether it is AGN or unusual star formation that is driving red colours in these systems.},

This is particularly noticeable when luminosity functions are produced for a number of different redshift ranges as is common in the study of AGN or galaxy evolution. We present a simple method of constructing a binned luminosity function which overcomes this problem and has a number of other advantages over the traditional 1/Va method. We also describe a practical method for comparing binned and model luminosity functions, by calculating the expectation values of the binned luminosity function from the model. Binned luminosity functions produced by the two methods are compared for simulated data and for the Large Bright QSO Survey (LBQS). It is shown that the 1/Va method produces a very misleading picture of evolution in the LBQS. The binned luminosity function of the LBQS is then compared with a model two-power-law luminosity function undergoing pure luminosity evolution from Boyle et al. The comparison is made using a model luminosity function averaged over each redshift shell, and using the expectation values for the binned luminosity function calculated from the model. The luminosity function averaged in each redshift shell gives a misleading impression that the model over predicts the number of QSOs at low luminosity even for 1.0{\textless} z{\textless}1.5, when model and data are consistent. The expectation values show that there are significant differences between model and data: the model overpredicts the number of low luminosity sources at both low and high redshift. The luminosity function does not appear to steepen relative to the model as redshift increases.},

This yields a set of optical spectra of 912 candidate NVSS counterparts, of which we identify 757 as genuine radio identifications - the largest and most homogeneous set of radio source spectra ever obtained. The 2dFGRS radio sources span the redshift range z=0.005 to 0.438, and are a mixture of active galaxies (60 per cent) and star-forming galaxies (40 per cent). About 25 per cent of the 2dFGRS radio sources are spatially resolved by NVSS, and the sample includes three giant radio galaxies with projected linear size greater than 1Mpc. The high quality of the 2dF spectra means we can usually distinguish unambiguously between AGN and star-forming galaxies. We make a new determination of the local radio luminosity function at 1.4GHz for both active and star-forming galaxies, and derive a local star formation density of 0.022+/-0.004Msolaryr-1Mpc-3 (H0=50kms-1Mpc-1).},

Because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in a spectroscopic survey, the luminosity density could still be significantly underestimated. We also find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies compared to the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the VVDS compared to former estimates. Therefore, the VVDS paints a quite different picture of the role of the most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile, program 070.A-9007(A). {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

The break luminosity is close to the dividing line between the two Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes for the large-scale radio structure of these objects. We use an analytical model for the luminosity and size evolution of FR type II (FRII) objects together with a simple prescription for FR type I (FRI) sources to construct the RLF. We postulate that all sources start out with a FRII morphology. Weaker jets subsequently disrupt within the quasi-constant density cores of their host galaxies and develop the turbulent lobes of FRI. With this model, we recover the slopes of the power laws and the break luminosity of the RLF determined from observations. The rate at which active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets of jet power Q appear in the universe is found to be proportional to Q-1.6. The model also roughly predicts the distribution of the radio lobe sizes for FRII objects, if the radio luminosity of the turbulent jets drops significantly at the point of disruption. We show that our model is consistent with recent ideas of two distinct accretion modes in jet-producing AGN if radiative efficiency of the accretion process is correlated with jet power.},

	abstract = {We show that using either the method of Page \& Carrera or the well-known 1/Va method to construct the binned luminosity function (LF) of a flux limited sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can produce an artificial flattening (or steepening in the case of negative evolution) of the binned LF for bins intersected by the flux cutoff of the sample. This effect is more pronounced for samples with steep and strongly evolving parent LFs but is still present even for non-evolving LFs. As a result of this distortion of the true LF, fitting a model LF to binned data may lead to errors in the estimation of the parameters and may even prompt the erroneous use of broken power-law functions. We compute the expected positions of apparent breaks in the binned LF. We show that these spurious breaks in the binned LFs can be avoided if the binning is done in the flux-redshift plane instead of the typically used luminosity-redshift plane. Binning in the flux-redshift plane can be used in conjunction with the binning in the luminosity-redshift plane to test for real breaks in the binned LFs and to identify the features that are the result of binning biases. We illustrate this effect for most typical forms of luminosity dependence and redshift evolution and show how the proposed method helps address this problem. We also apply this method to the MOJAVE AGN sample and show that it eliminates an apparent break in the binned LF.},

Three methods, including the 1/Vmax and the parametric and non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimators, are used and the results agree well with each other. A density evolution {\textasciitilde} (1 + z)3.4+/-0.9 or a luminosity evolution {\textasciitilde} exp(1.7tL/τ), where tL is the look-back time, is detected in the full sample in the redshift range [0.02, 0.1], consistent with previous analyses. Of the four infrared subpopulations, cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts show similar evolutionary trends, galaxies with significant active galactic nucleus contributions show stronger positive evolution and Arp 220-type starbursts exhibit strong negative evolution. The dominant subpopulation changes from cirrus-type galaxies to M82-type starbursts at log10(L60/Lsolar) {\textasciitilde} 10.3. In the second half of the paper, we derive the projected two-point spatial correlation function for galaxies of different infrared template types. The mean relative bias between cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts, which correspond to quiescent galaxies with optically thin interstellar dust and actively star-forming galaxies, respectively, is calculated to be bcirrus/bM82 = 1.25 +/- 0.07. The relation between the current star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming galaxies and environment is investigated by looking at the dependence of clustering on infrared luminosity. We found that M82-type actively star-forming galaxies show stronger clustering as infrared luminosity/SFR increases. The correlation between the clustering strength and SFR in the local Universe seems to echo the basic trend seen in star-forming galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey fields (at z {\textasciitilde} 1).},

	abstract = {We present new observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10keV X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We utilize data from a number of surveys including both the 2Ms Chandra Deep Fields and the AEGIS-X 200ks survey, enabling accurate measurements of the evolution of the faint end of the XLF. We combine direct, hard X-ray selection and spectroscopic follow-up or photometric redshift estimates at z {\textless} 1.2 with a rest-frame UV colour pre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated with catastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. Only robust optical counterparts to X-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matching technique. A Bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshift probability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our high-redshift samples and allows robust comparison of different evolutionary models. We statistically account for X-ray sources without optical counterparts to correct for incompleteness in our samples. We also account for Poissonian effects on the X-ray flux estimates and sensitivities and thus correct for the Eddington bias. We find that the XLF retains the same shape at all redshifts, but undergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z {\textasciitilde} 1, and an overall negative density evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolution at earlier times. We do not find evidence that a luminosity-dependent density evolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required to describe the evolution of the XLF. We find significantly higher space densities of low-luminosity, high-redshift AGN than in prior studies, and a smaller shift in the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasing luminosity. The total luminosity density of AGN peaks at z = 1.2 +/- 0.1, but there is a mild decline to higher redshifts. We find that {\textgreater}50 per cent of black hole growth takes place at z {\textgreater} 1, with around half in LX {\textless} 1044ergs-1 AGN.},

	abstract = {We studied the active galactic nucleus (AGN) radio emission from a compilation of hard X-ray-selected samples, all observed in the 1.4 GHz band. A total of more than 1600 AGNs with 2-10 keV de-absorbed luminosities higher than 1042 erg s-1 cm-2 were used. For a sub-sample of about fifty z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 AGNs, it was possible to reach {\textasciitilde}80\% of radio detections and therefore, for the first time, it was possible to almost completely measure the probability distribution function of the ratio between the radio and the X-ray luminosity RX = log(L 1.4/LX ), where L 1.4/LX = νL ν(1.4 GHz)/LX (2-10 keV). The probability distribution function of RX was functionally fitted as dependent on the X-ray luminosity and redshift, P(RX {\textbar}LX , z). It roughly spans over six decades (-7{\textless} RX {\textless}-1) and does not show any sign of bi-modality. The result is that the probability of finding large values of the RX ratio increases with decreasing X-ray luminosities and (possibly) with increasing redshift. No statistically significant difference was found between the radio properties of the X-ray absorbed (N H{\textgreater}1022 cm-2) and un-absorbed AGNs. Measurement of the probability distribution function of RX allowed us to compute the kinetic luminosity function and the kinetic energy density which, at variance with that assumed in many galaxy evolution models, is observed to decrease by about a factor of 5 at redshift below 0.5. About half of the kinetic energy density results in being produced by the more radio quiet (RX {\textless}-4) AGNs. In agreement with previous estimates, the AGN efficiency epsilonkin in converting the accreted mass energy into kinetic power (L\_K=ɛ\_kin{\textbackslash}dot\{m\} c{\textasciicircum}2) is, on average, epsilonkin {\textasciitilde}= 5 × 10-3. The data suggest a possible increase of epsilonkin at low redshifts.},

	abstract = {Context. The study of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) in different environments provides powerful constraints on the physics of galaxy evolution. The infrared (IR) LF is a particularly useful tool since it is directly related to the distribution of galaxy star-formation rates (SFRs). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to determine the galaxy IR LF as a function of the environment in a supercluster at redshift 0.23 to shed light on the processes driving galaxy evolution in and around clusters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We base our analysis on multi-wavelength data, which include optical, near-IR, and mid- to far-IR photometry, as well as redshifts from optical spectroscopy. We identify 467 supercluster members in a sample of 24-μm-selected galaxies, on the basis of their spectroscopic (153) and photometric (314) redshifts. IR luminosities and stellar masses are determined for supercluster members via spectral energy distribution fitting. Galaxies with active galactic nuclei are identified by a variety of methods and excluded from the sample. SFRs are obtained for the 432 remaining galaxies from their IR luminosities via the Kennicutt relation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We determine the IR LF of the whole supercluster as well as the IR LFs of three different regions in the supercluster: the cluster core, a large-scale filament, and the cluster outskirts (excluding the filament). A comparison of the IR LFs of the three regions, normalized by the average number densities of r-band selected normal galaxies, shows that the filament (respectively, the core) contains the highest (respectively, the lowest) fraction of IR-emitting galaxies at all levels of IR luminosities, and the highest (respectively, the lowest) total SFR normalized by optical galaxy richness. Luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs) are almost absent in the core region. The relation between galaxy specific SFRs and stellar masses does not depend on the environment, and it indicates that most supercluster LIRGs are rather massive galaxies with relatively low specific SFRs. A comparison with previous IR LF determinations from the literature confirms that the mass-normalized total SFR in clusters increases with redshift, but more rapidly than previously suggested for redshifts ≲ 0.4. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The IR LF shows an environmental dependence that is not simply related to the local galaxy density. The filament, an intermediate-density region in the A1763 supercluster, contains the highest fraction of IR-emitting galaxies. We interpret our findings within a possible scenario for the evolution of galaxies in and around clusters.},

	abstract = {Semi-analytic models (SAMs) are currently one of the primary tools with which we model statistically significant ensembles of galaxies. The underlying physical prescriptions inherent to each SAM are, in many cases, different from one another. Several SAMs have been applied to the dark matter merger trees extracted from the Millennium Run, including those associated with the well-known Munich and Durham lineages. We compare the predicted luminosity distributions of galaxy groups using four publicly available SAMs, in order to explore a galactic environment in which the models have not been explored to the same degree as they have in the field or in rich clusters. We identify a characteristic 'wiggle' in the group galaxy luminosity function generated using the De Lucia et al. SAM, which is not present in the Durham-based models, consistent to some degree with observations. However, a comparison between conditional luminosity functions of groups between the models and observations suggests that neither model is a particularly good match. The luminosity function wiggle is interpreted as the result of the two-mode active galactic nucleus feedback implementation used in the Munich models, which itself results in flattened magnitude gap distribution. An associated analysis of the magnitude gap distribution between first- and second-ranked group galaxies shows that while the Durham models yield distributions with approximately equal luminosity first- and second-ranked galaxies, in agreement with observations, the De Lucia et al. models favour the scenario in which the second-ranked galaxy is approximately 1 mag fainter than the primary, especially when the dynamic range of the mock data is limited to 3 mag.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new grid-based method for investigating the evolution of the steep-spectrum radio luminosity function, with the aim of quantifying the high-redshift cut-off suggested by previous work. To achieve this, the Combined EIS-NVSS Survey of Radio Sources (CENSORS) has been developed; this is a 1.4-GHz radio survey, containing 135 sources complete to a flux density of 7.2 mJy, selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) over 6 deg2 of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) Patch D. The sample is currently 73 per cent spectroscopically complete, with the remaining redshifts estimated via the K-z or I-z magnitude-redshift relation. CENSORS is combined with additional radio data from the Parkes All-Sky, Parkes Selected Regions, Hercules and Very Large Array (VLA) COSMOS samples to provide comprehensive coverage of the radio power versus redshift plane. The redshift distributions of these samples, together with radio source count determinations, and measurements of the local luminosity function, provide the input to the fitting process. The modelling reveals clear declines, at {\textgreater}3σ significance, in comoving density at z {\textgreater} 0.7 for lower luminosity sources (log P = 25-26); these turnovers are still present at log P {\textgreater} 27, but move to z ≳ 3, suggesting a luminosity-dependent evolution of the redshift turnover, similar to the 'cosmic downsizing' seen for other active galactic nucleus populations. These results are shown to be robust to the estimated redshift errors and to increases in the spectral index for the highest redshift sources. Analytic fits to the best-fitting steep spectrum grid are provided so that the results presented here can be easily accessed by the reader, as well as allowing plausible extrapolations outside of the regions covered by the input data sets.},

Our sample consists of 39 996 NUV {\textless} 22.8 emission line galaxies in the redshift range 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9. This sample selects galaxies with high star formation rates: at 0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9 the median star formation rate is at the upper 95th percentile of optically selected (r {\textless} 22.5) galaxies and the sample contains about 50 per cent of all NUV {\textless} 22.8, 0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9 starburst galaxies within the volume sampled. The most luminous galaxies in our sample ( - 21.0 {\textgreater} MNUV {\textgreater} -22.5) evolve very rapidly with a number density declining as (1 + z)5±1 from redshift z = 0.9 to 0.6. These starburst galaxies (MNUV {\textless} -21 is approximately a star formation rate of 30 M⊙ yr-1) contribute about 1 per cent of cosmic star formation over the redshift range z = 0.6-0.9. The star formation rate density of these very luminous galaxies evolves rapidly, as (1 + z)4±1. Such a rapid evolution implies that the majority of star formation in these large galaxies must have occurred before z = 0.9. We measure the UV luminosity function in Δz = 0.05 redshift intervals spanning 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9, and provide analytic fits to the results. Our measurements of the luminosity function over this redshift range probe further into the bright end (1-2 mag further) than previous measurements, e.g. Arnouts et al., Budavári et al. and Treyer et al., due to our much larger sample size and sampled volume. At all redshifts z {\textgreater} 0.55 we find that the bright end of the luminosity function is not well described by a pure Schechter function due to an excess of very luminous (MNUV {\textless} -22) galaxies. These luminosity functions can be used to create a radial selection function for the WiggleZ survey or test models of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we test the AGN feedback model in Scannapieco, Silk \& Bouwens, and find that this AGN feedback model requires AGN feedback efficiency to vary with one or more of the following: stellar mass, star formation rate and redshift.},

The clusters were identified as Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) color-selected overdensities in the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN project, which imaged 420 powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) at z {\textgreater} 1.3. The luminosity functions are derived for different redshift and richness bins, and the IRAC imaging reaches depths of m* + 2, allowing us to measure the faint end slopes of the luminosity functions. We find that α = -1 describes the luminosity function very well in all redshift bins and does not evolve significantly. This provides evidence that the rate at which the low mass galaxy population grows through star formation gets quenched and is replenished by in-falling field galaxies does not have a major net effect on the shape of the luminosity function. Our measurements for m* are consistent with passive evolution models and high formation redshifts (zf {\textasciitilde} 3). We find a slight trend toward fainter m* for the richest clusters, implying that the most massive clusters in our sample could contain older stellar populations, yet another example of cosmic downsizing. Modeling shows that a contribution of a star-forming population of up to 40\% cannot be ruled out. This value, found from our targeted survey, is significantly lower than the values found for slightly lower redshift, z {\textasciitilde} 1, clusters found in wide-field surveys. The results are consistent with cosmic downsizing, as the clusters studied here were all found in the vicinity of RLAGNs—which have proven to be preferentially located in massive dark matter halos in the richest environments at high redshift—and they may therefore be older and more evolved systems than the general protocluster population.},

We find that the LF varies smoothly with overdensity, consistent with previous results, with little environmental dependent evolution over the last 3 Gyr. The modified GALFORM model predictions agree remarkably well with our LFs split by environment, particularly in the most overdense environments. The LFs predicted by the model for both blue and red galaxies are consistent with GAMA for the environments and luminosities at which such galaxies dominate. Discrepancies between the model and the data seen in the faint end of the LF suggest too many faint red galaxies are predicted, which is likely to be due to the over-quenching of satellite galaxies. The excess of bright blue galaxies predicted in underdense regions could be due to the implementation of AGN feedback not being sufficiently effective in the lower mass haloes.},

We find that the traditional bivariate RLF estimators can cause bias in varying degrees.

We believe that the bias is caused because the K-corrections complicate the truncation boundary on the L-z plane of the sample, but the traditional bivariate RLF estimators have difficulty dealing with this boundary condition properly. We suggest that the spectral index distribution should be incorporated into the RLF analysis process to obtain a robust estimation.

	abstract = {Following previous work, we further confirm that the cosmic evolution of steep-spectrum radio-loud AGNs (active galactic nuclei) can be reproduced by a simple combination of density evolution (DE) and luminosity evolution (LE). This mixture evolution scenario can naturally explain the luminosity-dependent evolution of radio-loud AGNs. Our models successfully fitted a large amount of data on radio luminosity functions of steep-spectrum sources and multi-frequency source counts. The modeling indicates that the DE slowly increases as \{(1+z)\}0.3∼ 1.3 out to z∼ 0.8, and then rapidly decreases as \{(1+z)\}-6.8∼ -5.7, while the LE rapidly increases as \{(1+z)\}4.8 out to a higher redshift (at least z{\textgreater} 3.5). We find a high-redshift decline (i.e., redshift cutoff) in the number density of steep-spectrum radio sources, but we cannot conclude whether such a decline is sharp or shallow. We believe that whether a redshift cutoff occurs or not depends mainly on DE, while its steepness is decided by LE, which, however, cannot be well constrained due to the lack of high-redshift samples. Most intriguingly, according to our mixture evolution scenario, there appears to be no need for different evolution for the low- and high-power radio-loud AGNs. Both types of sources experience the same combined evolution of DE and LE.},

	abstract = {The lack of a strong correlation between AGN X-ray luminosity (LX; a proxy for AGN power) and the star formation rate (SFR) of their host galaxies has recently been attributed to stochastic AGN variability. Studies using population synthesis models have incorporated this by assuming a broad, universal (i.e. does not depend on the host galaxy properties) probability distribution for AGN specific X-ray luminosities (i.e. the ratio of LX to host stellar mass; a common proxy for Eddington ratio). However, recent studies have demonstrated that this universal Eddington ratio distribution fails to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions beyond z ∼ 1.2. Furthermore, empirical studies have recently shown that the Eddington ratio distribution may instead depend upon host galaxy properties, such as SFR and/or stellar mass. To investigate this further, we develop a population synthesis model in which the Eddington ratio distribution is different for star-forming and quiescent host galaxies. We show that, although this model is able to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions out to z ∼ 2, it fails to simultaneously reproduce the observed flat relationship between SFR and X-ray luminosity. We can solve this, however, by incorporating a mass dependency in the AGN Eddington ratio distribution for star-forming host galaxies. Overall, our models indicate that a relative suppression of low Eddington ratios (λEdd ≲ 0.1) in lower mass galaxies (M* ≲ 1010 - 11 M⊙) is required to reproduce both the observed X-ray luminosity functions and the observed flat SFR/X-ray relationship.},

These 3740 z ∼ 4 galaxies are selected from broadband imaging in nine photometric bands over 18 deg2 in the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large Area Survey field. The large area and moderate depth of our survey provide a unique view of the intersection between the bright end of the galaxy UV luminosity function (M AB {\textless} -22) and the faint end of the AGN UV luminosity function. We do not separate AGN-dominated galaxies from star-formation-dominated galaxies, but rather fit both luminosity functions simultaneously. These functions are best fit with a double power law for both the galaxy and AGN components, where the galaxy bright-end slope has a power-law index of -3.80 ± 0.10 and the corresponding AGN faint-end slope is \{α \vphantom{\{}\}AGN\}=-\{1.49\}-0.21+0.30. We cannot rule out a Schechter-like exponential decline for the galaxy UV luminosity function, and in this scenario the AGN luminosity function has a steeper faint-end slope of -\{2.08\}-0.11+0.18. Comparison of our galaxy luminosity function results with a representative cosmological model of galaxy formation suggests that the molecular gas depletion time must be shorter, implying that star formation is more efficient in bright galaxies at z = 4 than at the present day. If the galaxy luminosity function does indeed have a power-law shape at the bright end, the implied ionizing emissivity from AGNs is not inconsistent with previous observations. However, if the underlying galaxy distribution is Schechter, it implies a significantly higher ionizing emissivity from AGNs at this epoch.},

	abstract = {The radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are traditionally measured based on total emission, which does not reflect the current activity of the central black hole. The increasing interest in compact radio cores of AGNs motivates determination of the RLF based on core emission (i.e., core RLF). In this work we have established a large sample (totaling 1207) of radio-loud AGNs, mainly consisting of radio galaxies (RGs) and steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs). Based on the sample, we explore the relationship between core luminosity (L c ) and total luminosity (L t ) via a powerful statistical tool called “Copula.” The conditional probability distribution p(\{log\}\{L\}c{\textbar} \{log\}\{L\}t) is obtained. We derive the core RLF as a convolution of p(\{log\}\{L\}c{\textbar} \{log\}\{L\}t) with the total RLF that was determined by previous work. We relate the separate RG and SSRQ core RLFs via a relativistic beaming model and find that SSRQs have an average Lorentz factor of γ =\{9.84\}-2.50+3.61, and that most are seen within 8° ≲ θ ≲ 45° of the jet axis. Compared with the total RLF, which is mainly contributed by extended emission, the core RLF shows a very weak luminosity-dependent evolution, with the number density peaking around z ∼ 0.8 for all luminosities. Differences between core and total RLFs can be explained in a framework involving a combination of density and luminosity evolutions where the cores have significantly weaker luminosity evolution than the extended emission.},

	abstract = {We present the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, measured above and below the 5σ detection threshold, using a Bayesian model-fitting technique. The radio flux densities from Very Large Array (VLA)-COSMOS 3-GHz data are extracted at the position of stellar-mass-selected galaxies. We fit a local RLF model, which is a combination of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies (SFGs), in 10 redshift bins with a pure luminosity evolution model. Our RLF exceeds previous determinations at low radio luminosities at z {\textless} 1.6 with the same radio data, due to our ability to directly constrain the knee and faint-end slope of the RLF. Beyond z {\textasciitilde} 2, we find that the SFG part of the RLF exhibits a negative evolution (L* moves to lower luminosities) due to the decrease in low stellar-mass galaxies in our sample at high redshifts. From the RLF for SFGs, we determine the evolution in the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), which we find to be consistent with the established behaviour up to z {\textasciitilde} 1 using far-infrared data, but exceeds that from the previous radio-based work for the reasons highlighted above. Beyond z {\textasciitilde} 1.5 the cosmic SFRD declines. We note that the relation between radio luminosity and star formation rate is crucial in measuring the cosmic SFRD from radio data at z {\textgreater} 1.5. We investigate the effects of stellar mass on the total RLF by splitting our sample into low (108.5 ≤ M/M⊙ ≤ 1010) and high (\$M 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) stellar-mass subsets.

We find that this result is not affected by the inclusion, or exclusion, of narrow-emission-line galaxies at low redshift in the RIXOS and EMSS samples, and is insensitive to uncertainties in the conversion between flux values measured with ROSAT and Einstein.

Mild evolution is seen up to redshift order unity with star formation rate{\textasciitilde}(1+z)2.7. This is the first directly observed normal star-forming galaxy X-ray luminosity function (XLF) at cosmologically interesting redshifts (z{\textgreater}0). This provides the most direct measure yet of the X-ray-derived cosmic star formation history of the universe. We make use of Bayesian statistical methods to classify the galaxies and the two types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), finding the most useful discriminators to be the X-ray luminosity, X-ray hardness ratio, and X-ray to optical flux ratio. There is some residual AGN contamination in the sample at the bright end of the luminosity function. Incompleteness slightly flattens the XLF at the faint end of the luminosity function. The XLF has a lognormal distribution and agrees well with the radio and infrared luminosity functions. However, the XLF does not agree with the Schechter luminosity function for the Hα LF, indicating that, as discussed in the text, additional and different physical processes may be involved in the establishment of the lognormal form of the XLF. The agreement of our star formation history points with the other star formation determinations in different wavebands (IR, radio, Hα) gives an interesting constraint on the initial mass function (IMF). The X-ray emission in the Chandra band is most likely due to binary stars, although X-ray emission from nonstellar sources (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes and/or low-luminosity AGNs) remains a possibility. Under the assumption that it is due to binary stars, the overall consistency and correlations between single-star effects and binary-star effects indicate that not only is the one-parameter IMF (M) constant but also the bivariate IMF(M1, M2) must be constant, at least at the high-mass end. Another way to put this, quite simply, is that X-ray observations may be measuring directly the binary-star formation history of the universe. X-ray studies will continue to be useful for probing the star formation history of the universe by avoiding problems of obscuration. Star formation may therefore be measured in more detail by deep surveys with future X-ray missions.},

This is an on-going project that aims to identify X-ray-selected normal galaxies (i.e. non-AGN dominated) in the local Universe. We are using a total of 70 XMM-Newton fields covering an area of 11 deg2 which overlap with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2. Normal galaxies are selected on the basis of their resolved optical light profile, their low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio [log(fx/fo) {\textless} - 2] and soft X-ray colours. We find a total of 28 candidate normal galaxies to the 0.5-8keV band flux limit of {\textasciitilde}2 × 10-15ergcm-2s-1. Optical spectra are available for most sources in our sample (82 per cent). These provide additional evidence that our sources are bona fide normal galaxies with X-ray emission coming from diffuse hot gas emission and/or X-ray binaries rather than a supermassive black hole. 16 of our galaxies have narrow emission lines or a late-type spectral energy distribution (SED) while the remaining 12 present only absorption lines or an early-type SED. Combining our XMM-Newton sample with 18 local (z {\textless} 0.22) galaxies from the Chandra Deep Field North and South surveys, we construct the local X-ray luminosity function of normal galaxies. This can be represented with a Schechter form with a break at L*{\textasciitilde} 3+1.4-1.0× 1041ergs-1 and a slope of α{\textasciitilde} 1.78 +/- 0.12. Using this luminosity function and assuming pure luminosity evolution of the form {\textasciitilde}(1 +z)3.3 we estimate a contribution to the X-ray background from normal galaxies of {\textasciitilde}10-20 per cent (0.5-8keV).

We construct samples containing 2957 sources detected at hard (2-7 keV) X-ray energies and 4351 sources detected at soft (0.5-2 keV) energies from a compilation of Chandra surveys supplemented by wide-area surveys from ASCA and ROSAT. We consider the hard and soft X-ray samples separately and find that the XLF based on either (initially neglecting absorption effects) is best described by a new flexible model parametrization where the break luminosity, normalization, and faint-end slope all evolve with redshift. We then incorporate absorption effects, separately modelling the evolution of the XLFs of unabsorbed (20 {\textless} log NH {\textless} 22) and absorbed (22 {\textless} log NH {\textless} 24) AGNs, seeking a model that can reconcile both the hard- and soft-band samples. We find that the absorbed AGN XLF has a lower break luminosity, a higher normalization, and a steeper faint-end slope than the unabsorbed AGN XLF out to z ∼ 2. Hence, absorbed AGNs dominate at low luminosities, with the absorbed fraction falling rapidly as luminosity increases. Both XLFs undergo strong luminosity evolution which shifts the transition in the absorbed fraction to higher luminosities at higher redshifts.

In addition to a straightforward 1/V max approach, we also compute the intrinsic distributions, accounting for sample truncation by employing a forward-modeling approach to recover the observed BHMF and ERDF. As previous BHMFs and ERDFs have been robustly determined only for samples of bright, broad-line (Type 1) AGNs and/or quasars, ours are the first directly observationally constrained BHMF and ERDF of Type 2 AGNs. We find that after accounting for all observational biases, the intrinsic ERDF of Type 2 AGNs is significantly more skewed toward lower Eddington ratios than the intrinsic ERDF of Type 1 AGNs. This result supports the radiation-regulated unification scenario, in which radiation pressure dictates the geometry of the dusty obscuring structure around an AGN. Calculating the ERDFs in two separate mass bins, we verify that the derived shape is consistent, validating the assumption that the ERDF (shape) is mass-independent. We report the local AGN duty cycle as a function of mass and Eddington ratio, by comparing the BASS active BHMF with the local mass function for all supermassive black holes.

To this end, we constructed a sample of 149 luminous (L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2 − 10 keV{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}44{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) X-ray AGNs at z ≥ 3.5 selected in three fields with different depths and observed areas from the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey, XMM-XXL North, and eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey. We built their spectral energy distributions (SED) using the available multi-wavelength photometry from X-rays up to the far-IR. Then, we estimated the stellar mass, M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and the SFR of the AGNs using the X-CIGALE SED fitting algorithm. After applying several quality criteria, we ended up with 89 high-z sources. More than half (55\%) of the X-ray sample have spectroscopic redshifts. Based on our analysis, our high-z X-ray AGNs live in galaxies with a median M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 5.6 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and SFR{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≈ 240 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The majority of the high-z sources (∼89\%) were found inside or above the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies. Estimations of the normalised SFR, SFR{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}NORM{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, defined as the ratio of the SFR of AGNs, to the SFR of MS galaxies, show that the SFR of AGNs is enhanced by a factor of ∼1.8 compared to non-AGN star-forming systems. Combining our results with previous studies at lower redshifts, we confirmed that SFR{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}NORM{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} does not evolve with redshift. Using the specific black hole accretion rate (i.e. L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} divided by M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), λ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BHAR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, which can be used as a tracer of the Eddington ratio, we found that the majority of AGNs that lie inside or above the MS have higher specific accretion rates compared to sources below the MS. Finally, we found indications that the SFR of the most massive AGN host galaxies (log (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&gt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}11.5 − 12{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) remains roughly constant as a function of M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, in agreement with the SFR of MS star-forming galaxies.},

The method uses the probability distribution function (PDF) of posteriors obtained by fitting a consistent physical model to each object with a Bayesian method. The PDFs are often broadly distributed and may present systematic biases, such that naive point estimators or even some standard parametric modeling are not sufficient to reconstruct the parent population without obvious bias. Our method uses a transfer function computed from a large realistic simulation with the same selection as in the actual sample to redistribute the stacked PDF and then forward-fit a nonparametric model to it in a Bayesian way, so that the biases in the PDFs are properly taken into account. In this way, we are able to accurately reconstruct the parent distributions. We apply our spectral fitting and population inference methods to the XMM-COSMOS survey as a pilot study. For the 819 AGN detected in the COSMOS field, 663 (81\%) of which have spectroscopic redshifts (spec-z) and the others high-quality photometric redshifts (photo-z), we find prominent bi-modality with widely separated peaks in the distribution of the absorbing hydrogen column density (N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and an indication that absorbed AGN have harder photon indices. A clear decreasing trend of the absorbed AGN fraction versus the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is observed, but there is no clear evolution in the absorbed fraction with redshift. Our method is designed to be readily applicable to large AGN samples such as the XXL survey, and eventually eROSITA.},

	abstract = {X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) consist of several different emission and absorption components. To determine the spectral parameters, these components are often fitted manually with models chosen on a case-by-case basis. However, this approach has two problems. First, it becomes very hard for a survey with a large number of sources. Second, when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is low, there is a tendency to adopt an overly simplistic model, biasing the parameters and making their uncertainties unrealistic. We developed a Bayesian method for automatically fitting AGN X-ray spectra obtained by XMM-Newton with a consistent and physically motivated model. Our model includes all spectral components, even when the data quality is low. We used a physical model for the X-ray background and an empirical model for the non-X-ray background. Noninformative priors were applied on the parameters of interest, the photon index (Γ) and the hydrogen column density (N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), while informative priors obtained from deep surveys were used to marginalize over the parameter space of the nuisance parameters. To improve speed, we developed a specific spectral extraction and fitting procedure. We tested this method using a realistic sample of 5000 spectra, which was simulated based on our source model, reproducing typical population properties. Spectral parameters were randomly drawn from the priors, taking the luminosity function into account. Well-constrained or meaningful posterior probability density distributions (PDFs) were obtained for the most relevant spectral parameters, for instance, N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Γ, and L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, even at low S/N, but in this case, we were unable to constrain the parameters of secondary components such as the reflection and soft excess. As a comparison, a maximum-likelihood approach with model selection among six models of different complexities was also applied to this sample. We find clear failures in the measurement of Γ in most cases, and of N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} when the source is unabsorbed (N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}22{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). The results can hardly be used to reconstruct the parent distributions of the spectral parameters, while our Bayesian method provides meaningful multidimensional posteriors that will be used in a subsequent paper to infer the population.},

	abstract = {A complete census of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a prerequisite for understanding the growth of supermassive black holes across cosmic time. A significant challenge towards this goal is the whereabouts of heavily obscured AGN that remain uncertain. This paper sets new constraints on the demographics of this population by developing a methodology that combines X-ray spectral information with priors derived from multiwavelength observations. We select X-ray AGN in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey and fit their \$2.2{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!500{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$ spectral energy distributions with galaxy and AGN templates to determine the mid-infrared (\$6{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$) luminosity of the AGN component. Empirical correlations between X-ray and \$6{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$ luminosities are then adopted to infer the intrinsic accretion luminosity at X-rays for individual AGN. This is used as prior information in our Bayesian X-ray spectral analysis to estimate physical properties, such as line-of-sight obscuration. Our approach breaks the degeneracies between accretion luminosity and obscuration that affect X-ray spectral analysis, particularly for the most heavily obscured (Compton-Thick) AGN with low photon counts X-ray spectra. The X-ray spectral results are then combined with the selection function of the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey to derive the AGN space density and a Compton-Thick fraction of \$21.0{\textasciicircum}\{+16.1\}\_\{-9.9\}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ at redshifts z {\textless} 0.5. At higher redshift, our analysis suggests upper limits to the Compton-Thick AGN fraction of \${\textbackslash}lesssim 40\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$. These estimates are at the low end of the range of values determined in the literature and underline the importance of multiwavelength approaches for tackling the challenge of heavily obscured AGN demographics.},

The average obscured AGN fraction is 57\% ± 4\% for log L X/erg s-1 {\textgreater} 43. This work constrains the AGN obscuration and spectral shape of the still uncertain high-luminosity and high-redshift regimes (log L X/erg s-1 {\textgreater} 45.5, z {\textgreater} 3), where the obscured AGN fraction rises to 64\% ± 12\%. We report a luminosity and density evolution of the X-ray luminosity function, with obscured AGNs dominating at all luminosities at z {\textgreater} 2, and unobscured sources prevailing at log L X/erg s-1 {\textgreater} 45 at lower redshifts. Our results agree with the evolutionary models in which the bulk of AGN activity is triggered by gas-rich environments and in a downsizing scenario. Moreover, the black hole accretion density (BHAD) is found to evolve similarly to the star formation rate density, confirming the coevolution between AGN and host galaxy, but suggesting different timescales in their growing history. The derived BHAD evolution shows that Compton-thick AGNs contribute to the accretion history of AGNs as much as all other AGN populations combined.},

In this work, we place limits on the bright-end of the XLF at z = 5.7-6.4 using high-redshift AGN identified within the Extragalactic Serendipitous Swift Survey (ExSeSS) catalogue.

We also calculate an upper limit on the space density at higher luminosities where no additional sources are found, enabling us to place constraints on the shape of the XLF. Our results are consistent with the rapid decline in the space densities of high-luminosity AGN towards high redshift as predicted by extrapolations of existing parametric models of the XLF. We also find that our X-ray based measurements are consistent with estimates of the bolometric quasar luminosity function based on UV measurements at z ≳ 6, although they require a large X-ray to bolometric correction factor at these high luminosities.},

A sample of 73 AGNs, with redshifts of z {\textless} 2.5, is subdivided based on the optical spectra into subgroups of type 1 and 2 AGNs and no-AGN. The X-CIGALE code is used to produce the SEDs of these galaxies, fitting them with their observed flux densities. Accordingly, this code provides estimates of the physical properties, including the stellar mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio, far-UV attenuation, star-formation rate, and luminosity. All these properties and luminosity components, namely stellar, AGN, X-ray, and dust luminosities, are characterized versus the redshift. With the caveat that the sample is flux-limited and thus is affected by Malmquist bias, the results show that these properties increase as a function of redshift with various variation rates for each galaxy group, except for the far-UV attenuation of type 1 AGNs, which shows a slight reduction with redshift. The stellar, AGN, and X-ray luminosities show tight correlations with the intrinsic AGN luminosity, which is, in principle, attributed to the intrinsic AGN accretion power acting as a fuelling source. This power has an impact on most other correlations versus the redshift when the intrinsic AGN luminosity increases with redshift. Owing to their different emission sources, these luminosities make different fractional contributions to the total luminosity. The stellar luminosity, where the dust luminosity is the most effective, has the highest contribution of all galaxy groups, while the AGN luminosity has the lowest.},

	abstract = {Almost all massive galaxies today are understood to contain supermassive black holes (SMBH) at their centres. SMBHs grew by accreting material from their surroundings, emitting X-rays as they did so. X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in order to understand the AGN population's cosmological properties and evolution. We present a new fixed rest-frame method to achieve a more accurate study of the AGN XLF evolution over cosmic time. Normally, XLFs are constructed in a fixed observer-frame energy band, which can be problematic because it probes different rest-frame energies at different redshifts. In the new method, we construct XLFs in the fixed rest-frame band instead, by varying the observed energy band with redshift. We target a rest-frame 2-8 keV band using XMM-Newton and HEAO 1 X-ray data, with seven observer-frame energy bands that vary with redshift for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 3. We produce the XLFs using two techniques; one to construct a binned XLF, and one using a maximum likelihood (ML) fit, which makes use of the full unbinned source sample. We find that our ML best-fitting pure luminosity evolution results for both methods are consistent with each other, suggesting that performing XLF evolution studies with the high-redshift data limited to high-luminosity AGN is not very sensitive to the choice of fixed observer-frame or rest-frame energy band, which is consistent with our expectation that high-luminosity AGN typically show little ABSORPTION. We have demonstrated the viability of the new method in measuring the XLF evolution.},

	abstract = {The star formation rate density (SFRD) history of the universe is well constrained up to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 2. At earlier cosmic epochs, the picture has been largely inferred from UV-selected galaxies (e.g., Lyman-break galaxies; LBGs). However, the inferred star formation rates of LBGs strongly depend on the assumed dust extinction correction, which is not well constrained at high z, while observations in the radio domain are not affected by this issue. In this work we measure the SFRD from a 1.4 GHz selected sample of {\textasciitilde}600 galaxies in the GOODS-N field up to redshift {\textasciitilde}3.5. We take into account the contribution of active galactic nuclei from the infrared-radio correlation. We measure the radio luminosity function, fitted with a modified Schechter function, and derive the SFRD. The cosmic SFRD shows an increase up to z {\textasciitilde} 2 and then an almost flat plateau up to z {\textasciitilde} 3.5. Our SFRD is in agreement with those from other far-IR/radio surveys and a factor 2 higher than those from LBG samples. We also estimate that galaxies lacking a counterpart in the HST/WFC3 H-band (H-dark) make up {\textasciitilde}25\% of the ϕ-integrated SFRD relative to the full sample at z {\textasciitilde} 3.2, and up to 58\% relative to LBG samples.},

Nearly all of the classical double sources at redshifts less than 0.5 have bridges linking the central galaxy with the outer edge of the source, and maps of these objects show that two-thirds of the bridge are significantly distorted near the central galaxy. Such distortions may be predicted from the jet model for double radio sources if the jet is much lighter than the confining medium, since the dynamics of the bridge region are then dominated by backflow of material that has passed through the hotspots. There is a correlation between axial ratio and luminosity which may be physically related to the compactness relation of Jenkins \& McEllin (1977).},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z {\textgreater} 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z {\textasciitilde} 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

The number of astronomical objects identified at z {\textgreater} 6 has increased dramatically over the last few years, but previously only three radio-loud (R2500 = fν,5 GHz/fν,2500 Å {\textgreater} 10) sources had been reported at z {\textgreater} 6, with the most distant being a quasar at z = 6.18. Here we present the discovery and characterization of PSO J172.3556+18.7734, a radio-loud quasar at z = 6.823. This source has an Mg II-based black hole mass of ∼3 × 108 M⊙ and is one of the fastest accreting quasars, consistent with super-Eddington accretion. The ionized region around the quasar is among the largest measured at these redshifts, implying an active phase longer than the average lifetime of the z ≳ 6 quasar population. From archival data, there is evidence that its 1.4 GHz emission has decreased by a factor of two over the last two decades. The quasar's radio spectrum between 1.4 and 3.0 GHz is steep (α = -1.31). Assuming the measured radio slope and extrapolating to rest-frame 5 GHz, the quasar has a radio-loudness parameter R2500 ∼ 90. A second steep radio source (α = -0.83) of comparable brightness to the quasar is only 23"1 away (∼120 kpc at z = 6.82; projection probability {\textless}2\%), but shows no optical or near-infrared counterpart.

	abstract = {Surveys with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered candidate galaxies in the first 400 Myr of cosmic time. The properties of these distant galaxies provide initial conditions for understanding early galaxy formation and cosmic reionisation. Preliminary indications have suggested these candidate galaxies may be more massive and abundant than previously thought. However, without spectroscopic confirmation of their distances to constrain their intrinsic brightnesses, their inferred properties remain uncertain. Here we report on four galaxies located in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging with photometric redshifts \$z{\textbackslash}sim10-13\$ subsequently confirmed by JADES JWST Near- Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations. These galaxies include the first redshift \$z{\textgreater}12\$ systems both discovered and spectroscopically confirmed by JWST. Using stellar population modelling, we find the galaxies typically contain a hundred million solar masses in stars, in stellar populations that are less than one hundred million years old. The moderate star formation rates and compact sizes suggest elevated star formation rate surface densities, a key indicator of their formation pathways. Taken together, these measurements show that the first galaxies contributing to cosmic reionisation formed rapidly and with intense internal radiation fields.},

We build upon our successful pilot study, presenting a new sample of low-frequency-selected candidate high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) over a sky area 20 times larger. We have refined our selection technique, in which we select sources with curved radio spectra between 72–231 MHz from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. In combination with the requirements that our GLEAM-selected HzRG candidates have compact radio morphologies and be undetected in near-infrared \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ -band imaging from the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey, we find 51 new candidate HzRGs over a sky area of approximately \$1200{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ . Our sample also includes two sources from the pilot study: the second-most distant radio galaxy currently known, at \$z=5.55\$ , with another source potentially at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 8\$ . We present our refined selection technique and analyse the properties of the sample. We model the broadband radio spectra between 74 MHz and 9 GHz by supplementing the GLEAM data with both publicly available data and new observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 5.5 and 9 GHz. In addition, deep \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ -band imaging from the High-Acuity Widefield K-band Imager (HAWK-I) on the Very Large Telescope and from the Southern Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey Regions \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ -band Survey (SHARKS) is presented for five sources.

	abstract = {Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we have conducted a blind redshift survey in the 3 mm atmospheric transmission window for 26 strongly lensd dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected with the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The sources were selected to have S\_1.4mm{\textgreater}20 mJy and a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio (S\_843MHz{\textless}6mJy) or far-infrared counterparts (S\_100um{\textless}1 Jy, S\_60um{\textless}200mJy). We robustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshifted emission lines of 12CO, 13CO, [CI], H2O, and H2O+. We find one or more spectral features in 23 sources yielding a {\textasciitilde}90\% detection rate for this survey; in 12 of these sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only a single line. For the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshift degeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or infer the most likely line identification based on photometric data. This yields secure redshifts for {\textasciitilde}70\% of the sample. The three sources with no lines detected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7{\textless}z{\textless}2.0. The resulting mean redshift of our sample is {\textless}z{\textgreater}=3.5. This finding is in contrast to the redshift distribution of radio-identified DSFGs, which have a significantly lower mean redshift of {\textless}z{\textgreater}=2.3 and for which only 10-15\% of the population is expected to be at z{\textgreater}3. We discuss the effect of gravitational lensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshift distribution to that of models in the literature.},

	abstract = {Determinations of the UV luminosity function of AGN at high redshifts are important for constraining the AGN contribution to reionization and understanding the growth of supermassive black holes. Recent inferences of the luminosity function suffer from inconsistencies arising from inhomogeneous selection and analysis of AGN data. We address this problem by constructing a sample of more than 80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While this sample is composed of multiple data sets with spectroscopic redshifts and completeness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to identical cosmologies, intrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems. Using this sample, we derive the AGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function has a double power law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude \$M\_*\$ of the AGN luminosity function shows a steep brightening from \$M\_*{\textbackslash}sim -24\$ at z=0.7 to \$M\_*{\textbackslash}sim -29\$ at z=6. The faint-end slope \${\textbackslash}beta\$ significantly steepens from \$-1.7\$ at \$z{\textless}2.2\$ to \$-2.4\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 6\$. In spite of this steepening, the contribution of AGN to the hydrogen photoionization rate at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 6\$ is subdominant ({\textless} 3\%), although it can be non-negligible ({\textasciitilde}10\%) if these luminosity functions hold down to \$M\_\{1450\}=-18\$. Under reasonable assumptions, AGN can reionize HeII by redshift z=2.9. At low redshifts (z{\textless}0.5), AGN can produce about half of the hydrogen photoionization rate inferred from the statistics of HI absorption lines in the IGM. Our global analysis of the luminosity function also reveals important systematic errors in the data, particularly at z=2.2--3.5, which need to be addressed and incorporated in the AGN selection function in future in order to improve our results. We make various fitting functions, luminosity function analysis codes, and homogenised AGN data publicly available.},
